# Themes

Themes transform the visual appearance of your media kit with one click. Apply professional design styles without any design skills required.

## What is a Theme?

A theme is a pre-designed visual style that includes:
- **Color scheme** - Coordinated colors for all elements
- **Typography** - Font styles and sizes
- **Spacing** - Consistent margins and padding
- **Visual elements** - Borders, shadows, and effects

Themes work on top of your content, so you can switch themes without losing any information.

- Get the best of both worlds

## Theme Customization

While themes provide preset styles, you can customize:

### Using Brand Kits

### Component-Level Adjustments
Some components allow individual style overrides in their settings.

For advanced users, custom CSS can be added in Settings > Advanced > Custom CSS.
