# Brand Kits

Brand Kits help you maintain consistent visual branding across all your media kits. Create your brand colors, typography preferences, and design tokens once, then apply them everywhere.

## What is a Brand Kit?

A Brand Kit is a collection of design settings that define your visual brand:

- **Color Palette** - Primary, secondary, accent, and neutral colors
- **Typography** - Font preferences and text styles
- **Design Tokens** - Spacing, borders, and other visual properties

When you link a Brand Kit to a media kit, all components automatically inherit your brand colors and styling.

## Creating a Brand Kit

### Step 1: Access Brand Kits

1. Go to your **Dashboard**
2. Click **Brand Kits** in the navigation
3. Click **Create New Brand Kit**

### Step 2: Name Your Brand Kit

Give your brand kit a descriptive name:
- "Personal Brand - Blue Theme"
- "Company Brand"
- "Speaking Engagements"

### Step 3: Define Your Colors

Set up your color palette:

| Color Role | Purpose | Example |
|------------|---------|---------|
| **Primary** | Main brand color, buttons, links | #2563EB (blue) |
| **Secondary** | Supporting elements, backgrounds | #1E40AF (dark blue) |
| **Accent** | Highlights, call-to-actions | #F59E0B (amber) |
| **Background** | Page background | #FFFFFF (white) |

| **Text Primary** | Main text color | #1E293B (dark slate) |
| **Text Secondary** | Supporting text | #64748B (slate) |

## Best Practices

### Color Selection

1. **Start with your logo** - Extract colors from your existing branding
2. **Ensure contrast** - Make sure text is readable against backgrounds
3. **Limit your palette** - 3-5 colors is usually enough
4. **Test on screens** - Colors can look different on various devices

### Consistency Tips

- Use the **same Brand Kit** for all your media kits
- Create **separate Brand Kits** if you have multiple brands or contexts
- Document your **hex codes** for use in other materials

### Accessibility

Ensure your color choices are accessible:
- Maintain sufficient contrast between text and backgrounds
- Don't rely on color alone to convey information
- Test with color blindness simulators

## Color Inspiration

Not sure where to start? Try these approaches:

1. **Use your existing brand colors** - Consistency across all materials
2. **Industry standards** - Blue for trust, green for health/eco, etc.
3. **Personality match** - Bold colors for dynamic brands, muted for sophisticated
4. **Color tools** - Use tools like Coolors.co or Adobe Color

## Troubleshooting

### Colors Not Applying

- Ensure the Brand Kit is properly linked to your media kit
- Check that you've saved your Brand Kit changes
- Try refreshing the editor

### Colors Look Different
