## Using AI Tools Effectively

### Step 1: Provide Good Input

The quality of output depends on your input. Be specific:

**Good input:**
> "I help SaaS founders scale from $1M to $10M ARR through my Revenue Acceleration System. I've helped 200+ companies increase revenue by an average of 40%."

**Less effective:**
> "I'm a business coach who helps people grow."

### Step 2: Generate Multiple Versions

Don't settle for the first result:
1. Click **Generate** to create initial content
2. Review the output
3. Click **Regenerate** for alternatives
4. Compare and choose the best version

### Step 3: Refine Your Content

Use the refinement features:
1. Select content you want to improve
2. Click **Refine** or provide feedback
3. AI adjusts based on your direction

**Example refinement prompts:**
- "Make it more conversational"
- "Add more specific numbers"
- "Shorten to under 50 words"
- "Make the tone more professional"

### Step 4: Save to Profile

Once you're happy with content:
1. Click **Save to Profile**
2. Content syncs across your media kit
3. Components using this content auto-update

## The 6 W's Framework

Many Guestify tools use the 6 W's Framework to create comprehensive messaging:

### Authority Hook (WHO, WHAT, WHEN, HOW)
- **WHO** - Who do you help? Be specific about your target audience.
- **WHAT** - What result do you deliver? Focus on outcomes.
- **WHEN** - When do they need you? The trigger or situation.
- **HOW** - How do you do it? Your unique approach or methodology.

### Impact Intro (WHERE, WHY)
- **WHERE** - Where is your credibility? Achievements, credentials, media features.
- **WHY** - Why do you do this? Your mission and purpose.

### Example

**WHO:** SaaS founders scaling past $1M ARR
**WHAT:** Predictable revenue growth of 40%+ in 90 days
**WHEN:** When they hit a growth plateau
**HOW:** My proven Revenue Acceleration System
**WHERE:** Featured in Forbes, worked with 200+ companies
**WHY:** Democratize startup success so every founder can win

## Tips for Best Results

### Be Specific
Vague inputs produce generic outputs. Include:
- Specific numbers and metrics
- Target audience details
- Unique methodology names
- Concrete achievements

### Start with Authority Hook
Build your Authority Hook first. It feeds into:
- Biography Generator
- Elevator Pitch Generator
- Guest Intro Generator
- And more...

### Use Tools in Sequence
For comprehensive messaging, work through tools in order:

1. **Authority Hook Builder** → Define your value proposition
2. **Impact Intro Builder** → Add credentials and mission
3. **Biography Generator** → Complete professional bio
4. **Elevator Pitch Generator** → Concise verbal pitch
5. **Guest Intro Generator** → Host-ready introduction

### Save and Sync
Save your generated content to your profile so it:
- Appears in your media kit automatically
- Can be reused across multiple tools
- Updates everywhere when you make changes

## Troubleshooting

### Output Doesn't Match My Voice

Try these refinements:
- "Use a more [casual/formal] tone"
- "Write like I'm talking to a friend"
- "Make it sound more like [example text]"

### Content is Too Generic

Provide more specific input:
- Add exact numbers and metrics
- Include industry-specific terminology
- Mention specific achievements

### Tool Isn't Generating

- Check your internet connection
- Ensure all required fields are filled
- Try refreshing the page
- Clear browser cache
