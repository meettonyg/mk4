# Tagline Generator

Create a memorable one-line description that captures who you are and what you do.

## Overview

A tagline is a short, memorable phrase that communicates your unique value. Unlike an elevator pitch, a tagline is:
- **Ultra-concise** (5-10 words)
- **Instantly memorable**
- **Easy to repeat**

Think of it as your professional catchphrase.

## What Makes a Great Tagline?

Great taglines are:
1. **Short** - 10 words or fewer
2. **Clear** - Immediately understandable
3. **Memorable** - Easy to recall and repeat
4. **Unique** - Differentiates you from others
5. **Benefit-focused** - Emphasizes value to others
