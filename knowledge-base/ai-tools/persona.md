# Persona Builder

Create a detailed ideal client avatar to focus your messaging and attract the right audience.

## Overview

A Persona is a detailed description of your ideal client. It goes beyond demographics to understand their:
- Goals and aspirations
- Challenges and frustrations
- Beliefs and objections
- Triggers and decision factors

A clear persona makes all your marketing more effective.

## Why Create a Persona?

With a defined persona:
- Your messaging becomes more specific
- Your content resonates more deeply
- You attract better-fit clients
- Sales conversations are easier
- You say no to wrong-fit opportunities

## Persona Components

### Demographics
- Age range
- Gender (if relevant)
- Location
- Income level
- Industry/profession
- Company size/role

### Psychographics
- Values and beliefs
- Aspirations and goals
- Fears and frustrations
- Lifestyle and interests

### Pain Points
- What problems are they experiencing?
- What have they tried that didn't work?
- What's the cost of not solving this?

### Goals
- What do they want to achieve?
- What does success look like?
- What's their timeline?

### Objections
- Why might they not buy?
- What concerns do they have?
- What's holding them back?

### Triggers
- What makes them ready to act?
- What events prompt them to seek help?
- What's the tipping point?

2. Click **Build Persona**
3. Review and add details
4. Give your persona a name

### Step 4: Use Everywhere

Reference your persona when:
- Writing copy
- Creating content
- Designing offers
- Qualifying leads

## Example Persona

### "Scaling Sarah"

**Demographics:**
- Female, 35-45
- Founder/CEO of a service business
- $1M-$5M annual revenue
- Team of 5-20 people
- Based in major US metro

**Goals:**
- Scale to $10M without burning out
- Build a team that doesn't depend on her
- Work fewer hours, not more
- Create real business value (potential exit)

**Pain Points:**
- Wearing too many hats
- Can't step away from the business
- Team keeps needing her input
- Revenue plateaued, not sure why
- Tried hiring but it didn't work

**Beliefs:**
- Quality matters more than speed
- Culture is essential for success
- There must be a better way
- She shouldn't have to do it all alone

**Objections:**
- "I've tried consultants before—they didn't understand my business"
- "I don't have time for a big engagement"
- "What if it doesn't work for my industry?"

**Triggers:**
- Just lost a key team member
- Missed a family event for work
- Received an acquisition offer but wasn't ready
- Hit a revenue ceiling for 2+ quarters

**Where She Hangs Out:**
- LinkedIn (daily)
- Industry conferences
- Mastermind groups
- Podcasts (business and personal development)

## Tips for Effective Personas

### Start with One
Don't create 10 personas. Start with your single ideal client.

### Use Real Data
Base your persona on actual clients, not assumptions.

### Give Them a Name
"Scaling Sarah" is more memorable than "Persona 1."

### Include Direct Quotes
What do they actually say?
> "I just want to take a vacation without everything falling apart."

### Update Regularly
Your ideal client may evolve as your business grows.

## Using Your Persona

### In Content Creation
Ask: "Would Sarah find this valuable?"

### In Sales Conversations
Qualify leads against your persona criteria.

### In Offer Design
Create offers that solve Sarah's specific problems.

### In Messaging
Use Sarah's language in your copy.

### In Saying No
If someone isn't like Sarah, they might not be a good fit.

## Multiple Personas

When you need more than one:
- **Different products** might serve different personas
- **Different entry points** might attract different people
- **Evolution** - clients might progress from one persona to another

Keep it simple: 2-3 personas maximum.

## Common Mistakes

### Too Broad
"Business owners who want to grow" describes everyone.

### Pure Fiction
Creating a persona based on who you want vs. who actually buys.

### Too Many Personas
More personas = more confusion = diluted messaging.

### Set and Forget
Personas should evolve with your business.
