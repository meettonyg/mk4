Subject: Why I turned down a $100K project

Hey [First Name],

Last Tuesday, I had a call with a potential client. They wanted to pay me $100K for a 6-month engagement.

I said no.

Not because I didn't need the money. But because I knew I couldn't deliver what they actually needed.

See, they thought their problem was marketing. But after 20 minutes of questions, I realized their real problem was product-market fit. No amount of my marketing magic was going to fix that.

Here's what I learned:

The best thing you can do for your reputation is say no to projects you can't win.

Your short-term bank account might suffer. But your long-term reputation will thank you.

This week, ask yourself: Is there a client or project you're holding onto that you know isn't right?

Sometimes the bravest thing is walking away.

Talk next week,
Sarah

P.S. If you're wondering how I handle those "it's not a fit" conversations, I break it down in this week's podcast episode: [link]

## Tips for Great Newsletters

### Be Consistent
Same day, same time, same format. Subscribers know what to expect.

### Write Like You Talk
Newsletters are personal. Write like you're emailing a friend.

### One Main Idea
Don't try to cover everything. Go deep on one thing.

### Tell Stories
Stories are more memorable than advice.

### Include One Clear CTA
What's the ONE thing you want them to do?

### Deliver Value First
Give more than you ask for.
