## First 2-3 Lines (Critical)

The first 2-3 lines show before "more" is clicked. Make them count:

### Include:
- What the video is about
- Why they should watch
- A hook or promise

### Examples:

**Good:**
> "The exact framework that 10x'd my speaking fees in one year. If you're a speaker charging less than you're worth, this video will change everything."

**Bad:**
> "Hey guys, welcome back to my channel! Today we're going to talk about something really interesting that I've been thinking about..."

## Timestamps (Chapters)

Timestamps create chapters and improve user experience:

### Format
```
0:00 - Introduction
1:30 - First main point
4:45 - Second main point
```

### Tips
- Start with 0:00
- Use consistent formatting
- Be descriptive but concise
- Include 5-10 timestamps for longer videos

## Keywords and SEO

### Where to Include Keywords
- First 2-3 lines
- Throughout description naturally
- In hashtags (limit 3-5)

### Keyword Types
- **Primary** - Main topic (e.g., "podcast guesting")
- **Secondary** - Related topics (e.g., "media kit," "podcast pitch")
- **Long-tail** - Specific phrases (e.g., "how to get booked on podcasts")

### Avoid

## Links Strategy

### Essential Links
- Lead magnet or free resource
- Product or service (if relevant)
- Subscribe/follow links

### Optional Links
- Related videos
