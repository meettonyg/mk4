# Impact Intro Builder

Complement your Authority Hook with credentials and mission to create a complete professional introduction.

## Overview

The Impact Intro extends your Authority Hook by adding two more dimensions:
- **WHERE** - Your credibility and credentials
- **WHY** - Your mission and purpose

Together with the Authority Hook (WHO, WHAT, WHEN, HOW), you have the complete "6 W's" that power all your professional messaging.

## The 6 W's Complete Framework

### From Authority Hook (Build First)
- **WHO** - Who you help
- **WHAT** - What transformation you deliver
- **WHEN** - When they need you
- **HOW** - Your unique approach

### Added by Impact Intro
- **WHERE** - Where is your credibility? (credentials, features, experience)
- **WHY** - Why do you do this? (mission, purpose, motivation)

## WHERE: Building Credibility

Your "WHERE" establishes why people should trust you:

### Types of Credentials
- **Media features:** "Featured in Forbes, Inc., and Entrepreneur"
- **Client results:** "Helped 200+ companies achieve..."
- **Experience:** "20 years in the industry"
- **Education:** "Harvard MBA, Stanford undergrad"
- **Awards:** "Named Top 40 Under 40"
- **Books:** "Author of the bestselling..."
- **Speaking:** "Keynoted at TED, SXSW, and..."

### Examples
> "My work has been featured in Forbes, Fast Company, and Harvard Business Review. I've helped 200+ SaaS companies collectively add $500M in revenue."

> "I'm a former Google executive with 15 years in product leadership. My frameworks are used by teams at Apple, Meta, and Netflix."

## WHY: Your Mission

Your "WHY" creates emotional connection:

### Questions to Answer
- What drives you to do this work?
- What change do you want to create?
- What's your origin story?
- Who are you fighting for?

### Examples
> "I do this because I believe every founder deserves access to the strategies that were once reserved for the venture-backed elite."

> "I'm on a mission to help one million women claim seats at the leadership table, because diverse leadership isn't just right—it's essential."

## How to Use

Answer:
- Why does this work matter to you?
- What change are you trying to create?
- What would you do even without getting paid?

### Step 4: Generate and Combine

1. Enter your WHERE and WHY
2. Click **Build Impact Intro**
3. Review how it combines with your Authority Hook

## Complete 6 W's Example

**WHO:** SaaS founders scaling past $1M ARR

**WHAT:** Predictable 40% revenue growth in 90 days

**WHEN:** When they've hit a growth plateau

**HOW:** My Revenue Acceleration System

**WHERE:** Featured in Forbes, helped 200+ companies add $500M collectively, former VP at Salesforce

**WHY:** I believe every founder deserves the growth strategies that were once reserved for the VC-funded elite

### Combined Into Full Intro:
> I help SaaS founders scaling past $1M ARR achieve predictable 40% revenue growth when they've hit a growth plateau, using my Revenue Acceleration System. As a former Salesforce VP featured in Forbes, I've helped 200+ companies collectively add $500M in revenue. I do this because I believe every founder deserves access to the strategies once reserved for the VC-funded elite.

## Tips for Impact

### Lead with Your Best Credential
Put your most impressive or relevant credential first.

### Be Specific with Numbers
- Not "many clients" → "200+ clients"
- Not "significant results" → "$500M in revenue"

### Make Your WHY Personal
Connect your mission to your story:
> "After watching my father's business fail because he didn't have access to the right strategies, I made it my mission to..."

### Keep It Authentic
Your WHY should be genuine. People can sense manufactured purpose.
