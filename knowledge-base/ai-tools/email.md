### Example
```
Subject: Guest idea: The hidden reason most service businesses plateau at $1M

Hi Sarah,

I've been binge-listening to Scaling Up for the past month—your episode with James Clear on habits was fantastic.

I'm the founder of GrowthLab and I've spent the last 10 years helping service businesses break through the $1M ceiling. I'd love to share my Revenue Acceleration System with your listeners.

I can speak about:
• Why most service businesses plateau (and it's not what you think)
• The 4-step framework that helped 200+ companies scale
• How to grow revenue without adding more hours

My work has been featured in Forbes and Inc., and I'm a former VP at Salesforce.

Would this be a fit for an upcoming episode?

Best,
John

P.S. Happy to send my media kit with interview questions if helpful.

## Common Mistakes

### Too Long
If they have to scroll, you've lost them.

### Too Generic
"I love your work" without specifics reads as copy-paste.

### Too Pushy
Respect "no" and "not now."

### Buried Ask
Put your request clearly, don't hide it.

### All About You
Focus on value to them, not your accomplishments.

## Email Etiquette

### Respond Promptly
Reply within 24-48 hours when possible.

### Be Professional
Proofread, use proper grammar, and avoid excessive informality.

### Honor Commitments
If you say you'll follow up, do it.

### Accept No Gracefully
"Thanks for considering it. If anything changes, let me know."
