# Framework Builder

Create and name your proprietary methodology to establish thought leadership and differentiate your approach.

## Overview

A Framework is your systematized approach to solving a problem. It's what separates "I help with marketing" from "I use my 5-Step Revenue Engine to transform your marketing." Frameworks:
- Establish you as an authority
- Make your process tangible
- Justify premium pricing
- Create intellectual property

## What is a Framework?

A framework is a named, structured approach that includes:
- **A memorable name** - "The Revenue Acceleration System"
- **Clear steps or phases** - Usually 3-7 components
- **Defined outcomes** - What each step achieves
- **Your unique perspective** - Why this approach works

## Types of Frameworks

### The Phased Process
Steps in a sequence:
> "The 5-Phase Product Launch Method: Research → Design → Test → Launch → Scale"

### The Pillar Model
Components that work together:
> "The 4 Pillars of Executive Presence: Voice, Posture, Eye Contact, Movement"

### The Matrix/Grid
Two dimensions creating quadrants:
> "The Urgency-Impact Matrix for Prioritization"

### The Acronym
Each letter represents a component:
> "The SPARK Method: Strategy, Positioning, Audience, Reach, Kinetics"

### The Formula
A mathematical or pseudo-mathematical expression:
> "Success = (Clarity × Action) ÷ Resistance"

## How to Use

### Step 1: Identify Your Core Process

What do you actually do with clients?
1. List every step you take
2. Group similar steps
3. Identify 3-7 main phases
4. Define the outcome of each

### Step 2: Name Your Framework

Your name should be:
- **Memorable** - Easy to recall
- **Descriptive** - Hints at the benefit
- **Ownable** - Unique to you

Naming formulas:
- "The [Number] [Noun] [System/Method/Framework]"
- "The [Adjective] [Noun] Method"
- "[Your Name] [Benefit] System"

### Step 3: Generate and Refine

1. Enter your process steps
2. Click **Build Framework**
3. Review naming options
4. Refine descriptions

## Examples

### Consultant Framework
**Name:** The Revenue Acceleration System

**Steps:**
1. **Audit** - Analyze current revenue streams and bottlenecks
2. **Architect** - Design optimized sales and marketing systems
3. **Activate** - Implement changes with your team
4. **Accelerate** - Scale what works, eliminate what doesn't
5. **Automate** - Build systems that run without you

### Coach Framework
**Name:** The Clarity-to-Confidence Method

**Steps:**
1. **Clarity** - Define exactly what you want
2. **Courage** - Identify and overcome limiting beliefs
3. **Capability** - Build the skills you need
4. **Confidence** - Practice until it becomes natural

### Speaker Framework
**Name:** The IMPACT Presentation Model

- **I** - Intrigue (hook your audience)
- **M** - Message (deliver your core idea)
- **P** - Proof (provide evidence)
- **A** - Action (give clear next steps)
- **C** - Callback (tie back to opening)
- **T** - Takeaway (memorable close)

## Tips for Strong Frameworks

### Use 3-7 Components
- Fewer than 3 feels incomplete
- More than 7 is hard to remember

### Make Each Step Distinct
Each component should have a clear, different purpose.

### Include Outcomes
For each step, define what changes:
> "Phase 2: Architect - You'll leave with a complete revenue roadmap."

### Create Visual Representation
Can it be drawn? Frameworks that visualize well are more memorable.

### Test for Memorability
Can someone recall your framework after hearing it once?

## Where to Use Your Framework

- **Website** - Dedicated page or section
- **Sales conversations** - Walk prospects through your process
- **Speaking** - Structure your keynotes
- **Books/Courses** - Organize your content
- **Media kit** - Methodology section
- **Proposals** - Show your approach

## Protecting Your Framework

### Trademark the Name
Consider trademarking your framework name for protection.

### Document It
Write detailed descriptions of each component.

### Create Assets
- Diagrams
- Worksheets
- Assessments

### Use It Consistently
The more you use your framework, the more it becomes associated with you.

## Common Mistakes

### Too Complex
If you can't explain it in 60 seconds, simplify.

### Generic Names
"The Success System" is forgettable. Be specific.

### Forced Acronyms
Don't twist words just to make an acronym work.

### Not Actually Using It
A framework you don't use with clients isn't a framework—it's marketing fiction.
