```

4. **Body** - Deliver the value
5. **Action** - What to do next

### Example Outline

**Title:** "5 Ways to Get Booked on More Podcasts"

1. Hook: "I got rejected by 50 podcasts before I figured this out."
2. Problem: "Most podcast pitches get deleted immediately."
3. Promise: "Here are 5 strategies that got me booked on 100+ shows."
4. Body:
   - Strategy 1: Research before you pitch
   - Strategy 2: Lead with value
   - Strategy 3: Make the host's job easy
   - Strategy 4: Follow up (the right way)
   - Strategy 5: Leverage each appearance
5. Action: "Download my podcast pitch template below."
