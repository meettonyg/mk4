"Most service business owners hit a wall around $1M. They're working more hours than ever but revenue has flatlined," said Chen. "This book shows them exactly how to break through that ceiling without sacrificing their health or relationships."

The book is available now on Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and through GrowthLab.com.

## Tips for Better Press Releases

### Lead with the News
The first paragraph should contain the essential information. Journalists are busy.

### Use Third Person
Write objectively, as if a reporter wrote it:
- Yes: "Chen announced..."
- No: "I am excited to announce..."

### Include Quotes
Quotes add personality and are often used directly by journalists.

### Keep It Short
One page is ideal. Two pages maximum.

### Make It Easy
Include:
- Contact information
- Links to resources
- High-res images
- Interview availability

### Be Specific
Include numbers, dates, and concrete details.

## What NOT to Do

### Don't Be Boring
"Company Announces New Product" is not newsworthy. Find the angle.

### Don't Use Jargon
Write clearly for general audiences.

### Don't Exaggerate
"Revolutionary" and "groundbreaking" are overused. Let the news speak.

### Don't Forget Follow-Up
Send, then follow up with targeted journalists.
