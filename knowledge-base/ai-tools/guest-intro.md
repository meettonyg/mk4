# Guest Intro Generator

Create a polished, host-ready introduction that podcast hosts can read when introducing you on their show.

## Overview

The Guest Intro Generator creates a professional introduction specifically designed to be read aloud by podcast hosts. Unlike a biography, a guest intro is:
- Written for verbal delivery (sounds natural when spoken)
- Concise (30-60 seconds when read)
- Designed to build credibility and interest quickly

## What Makes a Great Guest Intro?

A great guest intro:
1. **Flows naturally** when read aloud
2. **Builds credibility** quickly
3. **Creates curiosity** about what you'll discuss
4. **Includes pronunciation** guides if needed
5. **Respects time** (under 60 seconds)

## How to Use

### Step 1: Enter Your Information

Provide:
- Your name (with pronunciation if unique)
- Your title or role
- Key credentials (1-2 most impressive)
- What you'll discuss on the show
- A hook or interesting fact

### Step 2: Generate Your Intro

1. Click **Generate Intro**
2. Review the output
3. Read it aloud to test flow
4. Regenerate if needed

### Step 3: Customize

- Adjust length (short, medium, long)
- Add pronunciation guide
- Include specific talking points
- Modify tone (casual, professional, energetic)

Put your most impressive achievement first:

### End with a Hook
Create anticipation for the conversation:
- "...and today she's going to reveal why everything you know about X is wrong."
- "...and she's here to share the exact framework that generated $50M in revenue."

### Keep It Speakable
Avoid:
- Long company names
- Acronyms that need explanation
- Numbers that are hard to say quickly
