# Authority Hook Builder

Create a compelling value proposition that clearly communicates who you help and how you help them.

## Overview

The Authority Hook is the foundation of all your professional messaging. It answers four critical questions:
- **WHO** do you help?
- **WHAT** result do you deliver?
- **WHEN** do they need you?
- **HOW** do you do it uniquely?

Your Authority Hook feeds into your bio, elevator pitch, guest intro, and more.

## The 4 W's Framework

### WHO - Your Target Audience
Be specific about who you serve:
- Not just "business owners" but "SaaS founders scaling past $1M ARR"
- Not just "professionals" but "women executives in male-dominated industries"
- Not just "anyone" but "first-time authors ready to publish"

### WHAT - The Transformation
Focus on outcomes, not activities:
- Not "I teach marketing" but "I help you 3x your qualified leads"
- Not "I provide coaching" but "I help you land your dream role"
- Not "I offer consulting" but "I help you exit for 8 figures"

### WHEN - The Trigger Moment
When do people need you most?
- "When you've hit a growth plateau..."
- "When you're ready to scale but don't know how..."
- "When you're burning out but can't slow down..."

### HOW - Your Unique Approach
What's different about your method?
- A proprietary framework
- A unique process
- A contrarian approach
- A specific methodology

## How to Use

### Step 1: Answer Each Question

**WHO:** Who is your ideal client? Be specific.
**WHAT:** What transformation do you provide?
**WHEN:** What triggers them to seek help?
**HOW:** What makes your approach unique?

### Step 2: Generate Your Hook

1. Enter your answers
2. Click **Build Authority Hook**
3. Review the generated hook
4. Refine as needed

### Step 3: Use Across All Content

Your Authority Hook becomes the foundation for:
- Biography
- Elevator Pitch
- Guest Intro
- Website copy
- Social media bios

## Examples

### Consultant
> I help **SaaS founders scaling past $1M** (WHO) achieve **predictable 40% revenue growth** (WHAT) **when they've hit a growth plateau** (WHEN) through my **Revenue Acceleration System** (HOW).

### Coach
> I help **women executives in tech** (WHO) **land C-suite roles and negotiate 30%+ salary increases** (WHAT) **when they're ready for the next level but feel stuck** (WHEN) using my **Executive Presence Framework** (HOW).

### Speaker
> I help **conference organizers** (WHO) **deliver keynotes that get standing ovations and drive action** (WHAT) **when they need to inspire their audience** (WHEN) through **story-driven presentations backed by neuroscience** (HOW).

### Author
> I help **first-time authors** (WHO) **write and publish their book in 90 days** (WHAT) **when they have a message to share but don't know where to start** (WHEN) using my **Book Sprint Method** (HOW).

## Tips for Stronger Hooks

### Be Painfully Specific
**Weak:** "I help businesses grow"
**Strong:** "I help B2B SaaS companies reduce churn by 40%"

### Include Numbers When Possible
- "in 90 days"
- "40% increase"
- "6-figure"
- "3x growth"

### Name Your Method
Create a branded name for your approach:
- "The Revenue Acceleration System"
- "My 5-Step Launch Framework"
- "The Clarity Method"

### Focus on Transformation
People don't buy services; they buy outcomes:
- Not "marketing services" → "a pipeline full of qualified leads"
- Not "coaching" → "the confidence to ask for what you're worth"

## Where Your Authority Hook Appears

Once built, your Authority Hook powers:
- **Hero section** of your media kit
- **Bio introductions**
- **Elevator pitch** opening
- **Guest intro** core message
- **Website headlines**
- **Social media bios**

## Common Mistakes

### Too Broad
"I help people improve their lives" - *Who? How? Why you?*

### Feature-Focused
"I offer 1:1 coaching sessions" - *So what? What's the result?*

### Missing the "Only"
What makes you THE person for this? Why you specifically?

### Jargon-Heavy
"I leverage synergistic methodologies for optimal outcomes" - *Plain language wins*
