# NEW ISSUES DISCOVERED - 25 CODE IMPROVEMENTS
## Media Kit Builder v4.0 - Technical Debt & Optimization Opportunities

**Status**: Ready for Implementation  
**Last Updated**: October 2025  
**Total Issues**: 25 (P1: 8, P2: 17)

---

## üéØ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

After comprehensive code analysis of the Media Kit Builder codebase, I've identified **25 areas for improvement** spanning:
- **Security vulnerabilities** (XSS, CSRF, input validation)  
- **Performance bottlenecks** (unnecessary clones, cache misses, memory leaks)  
- **Code quality issues** (duplicate code, inconsistent patterns, missing error handling)  
- **Architecture problems** (tight coupling, circular dependencies, god objects)  
- **Developer experience** (poor error messages, missing documentation, debugging difficulties)

**Estimated Total Work**: 60-80 hours across all issues  
**Recommended Approach**: Address P1 issues first (critical/high impact), then P2 (optimization/cleanup)

## üí° IMPLEMENTATION TIPS

### For Each Issue:
1. **Read the full issue** in the detailed section
2. **Create a feature branch**: `git checkout -b fix/issue-##`
3. **Follow the fix steps** exactly as written
4. **Run the testing procedures** before committing
5. **Update documentation** as needed
6. **Create descriptive commit**: `fix: Issue #26 - Add CSRF protection to cache forms`

### Best Practices:
- ‚úÖ Fix one issue at a time (don't batch unless related)
- ‚úÖ Test thoroughly before moving to next issue
- ‚úÖ Update VISUAL-PROGRESS-SUMMARY.md after each fix
- ‚úÖ Run `npm run build` after JS changes
- ‚úÖ Check for regressions in related features
- ‚úÖ Use the "For New Conversation" templates for AI assistance
