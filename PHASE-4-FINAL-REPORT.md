## ⚠️ Known Issues & Resolutions

### Issue 1: Topics-Questions Component
**Problem**: May be duplicate of separate Topics + Questions components  
**Impact**: Low - functional but potentially redundant  
**Resolution**: Verify usage and remove if unneeded  
**Timeline**: Phase 5 cleanup

### Issue 2: Test Coverage Below Target
**Problem**: Only 15% coverage vs 80% target  
**Impact**: Medium - automated regression testing limited  
**Resolution**: Complete test generation and implementation  
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks  
**Status**: Tools ready, execution needed

### Issue 3: Accessibility Not Systematically Tested
**Problem**: Accessibility implemented but not verified  
**Impact**: Low-Medium - may have gaps  
**Resolution**: Systematic accessibility testing  
**Timeline**: Can be done in parallel  
**Status**: Planned for Phase 7

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Went Well ✅

1. **Consistent Architecture**
   - All components follow same pattern
   - Easy to understand and maintain
   - Clear separation of concerns

2. **Component Registry**
   - Single source of truth
   - Dynamic loading works perfectly
   - Easy to extend

3. **Vue Composition**
   - Clean, modern code
   - Good TypeScript-style patterns
   - Excellent reactivity

4. **CSS Variables**
   - Theme system integration smooth
   - No inline styles
   - Easy customization

### What Could Be Improved 🔧

1. **Test-First Approach**
   - Should have written tests alongside components
   - Now playing catch-up
   - **Future**: Always write tests first

2. **Component Documentation**
   - Should document as we build
   - Now need comprehensive pass
   - **Future**: Document inline with code

3. **Accessibility**
   - Should test accessibility immediately
   - Now need systematic audit
   - **Future**: Include in component checklist
