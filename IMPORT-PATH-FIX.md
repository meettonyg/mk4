# Import Path Fix - Build Ready

**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED  
**File**: `src/stores/mediaKit.js`  

## The Issue

After moving duplicate registry files to ARCHIVE, the build failed because `mediaKit.js` was still importing from the old (now archived) path:

```javascript
// ‚ùå OLD PATH (file moved to ARCHIVE)
import UnifiedComponentRegistry from '../vue/services/UnifiedComponentRegistry';
```

## The Fix

Updated import to point to the correct location:

```javascript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT PATH
import UnifiedComponentRegistry from '../services/UnifiedComponentRegistry';
```

## Build Now

Run the build command:

```bash
npm run build
```

The build should now succeed! üéâ
