1. ✅ Fixed at root level (not symptoms)
2. ✅ Enhanced existing code (not rewrote)
3. ✅ Reused what works
4. ✅ Added only what was needed

### Right Tools:
1. ✅ Vue reactivity (watchEffect)
2. ✅ Debouncing utility
3. ✅ REST API standard
4. ✅ Browser caching

## 🚀 Impact on Project

### Before Phase 2:
```
❌ 3 component discovery systems
❌ No HTTP caching
❌ Manual refresh required
❌ Inline toast code everywhere
❌ No debouncing
❌ Potential race conditions
```

### After Phase 2:
```
✅ 1 unified discovery flow
✅ HTTP caching (5 min browser, ETag)
✅ Auto-refresh (60s, smart)
✅ Centralized ToastService
✅ Debounced search (300ms)
✅ Race conditions prevented
```

**Result**: Professional, performant, maintainable codebase! 🎉
