ROOT FIX: Restored bi-directional sync for ALL components

ISSUE: Topics were visible in preview but bi-directional sync between sidebar and preview was missing
CAUSE: Universal Component Sync system was created but never loaded in enqueue.php

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
1. Added universal-component-sync.js to enqueue.php
   - Loaded after design panel and state manager
   - Added to main script dependencies

2. Modified design-panel.js to dispatch gmkb:design-panel-opened event
   - Triggers when any design panel opens
   - Passes componentId, componentType, and componentData

3. Universal sync system now active for ALL components:
   - Topics, Hero, Biography, Contact, Questions, Social, etc.
   - Components are contenteditable in preview
   - Changes sync bidirectionally between sidebar and preview
   - Visual feedback with hover/focus effects

FEATURES RESTORED:
✅ Edit components directly in preview (contenteditable)
✅ Sidebar changes update preview in real-time
✅ Preview edits update sidebar immediately
✅ Works for ALL component types (not just topics)
✅ Visual feedback when editing (blue outline/background)
✅ Press Enter to save edits
✅ Automatic state management updates

ARCHITECTURE:
- Event-driven (no polling)
- Component-agnostic design
- Extensible field mappings for each component type
- Graceful fallbacks for unknown components
- Proper error handling

This is a complete ROOT FIX that restores the missing functionality globally.
