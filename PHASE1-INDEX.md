## 📞 Support & Questions

### Common Questions:

**Q: How confident are you in these estimates?**
A: Very confident (HIGH). Based on actual code review, similar past work, and buffer included.

**Q: What if we don't have 1.5-2 days?**
A: Can split into smaller chunks or prioritize just Items #1 and #6 (6-9 hours).

**Q: What are the risks?**
A: LOW risk overall. All changes are refactoring internal architecture. Can be feature-flagged. Staging tested before production.

**Q: Can we defer some items?**
A: Yes! Items #2 and #3 are independent and can be done later. Items #1 and #6 are most impactful.

**Q: What if something goes wrong?**
A: We'll work in a feature branch with commits after each working item. Easy to rollback.

**Q: How do we know it's working?**
A: Comprehensive testing checklist provided. Manual and automated tests. Performance benchmarks.
