ROOT FIX: Proper bi-directional sync implementation

VIOLATIONS FIXED:
- Removed 7 patch files that violated checklist Phase 1 (no patches, fix root cause)
- Removed component-specific logic from universal sync (violates self-containment)
- Fixed Phase 2 Component Options UI to emit proper events
- Made universal sync truly component-agnostic

PROPER ARCHITECTURE:
1. Component Options UI now dispatches gmkb:component-editor-ready event
2. Universal sync listens for this event and connects generically
3. No component-specific code in universal systems
4. Components can self-register their own sync handlers

FILES MOVED TO ARCHIVE:
- auto-fix-topics-sync.js → debug/temp-fixes/
- console-fix-now.js → debug/temp-fixes/
- debug-sync-topics.js → debug/temp-fixes/
- fix-state-and-sync.js → debug/temp-fixes/
- fix-topics-sync-now.js → debug/temp-fixes/
- phase2-topics-sync-fix.js → debug/temp-fixes/
- quick-fix-console.js → debug/temp-fixes/

FILES FIXED:
- component-options-ui.js: Added event emission
- universal-component-sync.js: Removed component-specific logic
- enqueue.php: Removed all patch file references

This is a TRUE ROOT FIX that respects:
✅ Phase 1: No polling, event-driven, root cause fixed
✅ Phase 2: Reduced complexity, removed duplicate code
✅ Phase 5: Component self-containment maintained

The bi-directional sync now works through proper event coordination,
not patches and workarounds.
