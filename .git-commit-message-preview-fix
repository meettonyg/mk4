fix(theme-customizer): remove redundant preview panels from all tabs

ISSUE:
Theme Customizer had duplicate preview panels in each tab (Colors,
Typography, Spacing, Effects), violating WordPress UX standards and
confusing users with multiple preview areas.

ROOT CAUSE:
Each panel component was independently designed with its own preview
section. ThemeCustomizer.vue already has comprehensive LEFT preview
that updates in real-time from all panels, making panel previews
redundant and architecturally wrong.

FIX:
1. REMOVED entire preview section from ColorsPanel.vue
   - Removed "Live Preview" section (lines 44-69)
   - Removed all preview-related CSS (59 lines)
   - Result: 328 → 215 lines (113 lines removed)

2. REMOVED entire preview section from TypographyPanel.vue
   - Removed "Typography Preview" section (lines 107-128)
   - Removed previewStyles computed property (27 lines)
   - Removed all preview-related CSS (50 lines)
   - Result: 314 → 215 lines (99 lines removed)

3. REMOVED entire preview section from SpacingPanel.vue
   - Removed "Spacing Preview" section (lines 77-101)
   - Removed previewStyles computed property (11 lines)
   - Removed all preview-related CSS (84 lines)
   - Result: 288 → 207 lines (81 lines removed)

4. REMOVED entire preview section from EffectsPanel.vue
   - Removed "Effects Preview" section (lines 101-119)
   - Removed shadowMap, speedMap, cardStyles, buttonStyles (40 lines)
   - Removed all preview-related CSS (75 lines)
   - Result: 281 → 207 lines (74 lines removed)

TOTAL CODE REDUCTION:
- 367 lines of redundant code removed (30% reduction)
- 7 computed properties removed
- ~200 lines of preview CSS removed
- Zero functionality lost

RESULT:
- WordPress Theme Customizer standard restored (single left preview)
- Improved user experience (no confusing duplicate previews)
- Simplified architecture (single source of truth for preview)
- Better code quality (DRY principle properly applied)
- All functionality preserved (left preview updates from all panels)

TESTING:
✅ All four panels tested: only show controls
✅ Left preview updates in real-time from all panels
✅ Theme switching works correctly
✅ No functional regressions
✅ No JavaScript console errors
✅ Build completes successfully

ARCHITECTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
- Single source of truth for preview rendering
- Clear separation of concerns (controls vs preview)
- Reduced code complexity
- Easier maintenance (preview logic in one place)
- Better Vue reactivity utilization
