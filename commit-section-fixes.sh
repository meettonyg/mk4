git commit -m "Fix section controls and duplicate rendering issues

ROOT CAUSE FIXES:
1. Disabled duplicate section rendering in SectionRenderer.js
   - Main Renderer.js already handles section rendering
   - Prevents components appearing in multiple sections

2. Added professional SVG-based section controls styling
   - Created css/section-controls.css with proper SVG icon support
   - Replaced emoji-based controls with professional icons
   - Added hover states and responsive design

3. Updated enqueue.php to load section controls CSS
   - Ensures styles are properly loaded with lean bundle

RESOLVED ISSUES:
- Section controls now work properly
- Components no longer duplicate across sections
- Professional styling without emojis
- Proper event handling for section actions"
