# Syntax Error Fix Summary

## Problem
The `application-bundle.js` file had syntax errors due to multi-line console.log statements that were not properly escaped. This was causing:
```
Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token (at application-bundle.js?ver=1752357291:1132:21)
```

## Solution
Fixed all multi-line console.log statements by replacing line breaks within strings with `\n`.

## Changes Made
1. Line ~1132: Fixed `console.log('\nðŸ§ª ROOT FIX: Testing setTimeout interception...');`
2. Line ~1160: Fixed multiple console.log statements with line breaks
3. Line ~1550: Fixed `console.log('\nðŸ§ª TESTING PHP coordination elimination...');`
4. Line ~1570: Fixed multiple console.log statements in PHP coordination test
5. Line ~1635: Fixed `console.log('\nðŸ§ª TESTING validateBundleFix() function...');`
6. Line ~1660: Fixed multiple console.log statements in template polling test

## Result
The JavaScript syntax errors have been resolved. The application bundle should now load without errors.
