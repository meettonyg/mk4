# Component Controls Fix

## Problem
The previous rendering fix for the media kit builder, while successfully displaying components loaded from localStorage, inadvertently introduced a conflict in the component control handling (delete, move, duplicate buttons).

## Root Cause Analysis
The root cause was identified as a conflict between two separate JavaScript modules both trying to handle component controls:

1. **js/ui/element-controls.js**: This older module uses a general "event delegation" approach. It attaches a single click handler to the entire preview area and then tries to determine if a control button was clicked.

2. **js/components/component-renderer.js**: The newer, enhanced system attaches specific click handlers directly to each component's control buttons as they are rendered. This approach is more precise and handles all actions correctly, including Unicode symbols like '×' for delete.

When both systems were active, they would interfere with each other, causing control buttons to become unresponsive.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed the Conflicting Event Handler
- Removed the import of `setupElementControls` from main.js
- Removed the call to `setupElementControls()` in the `initializeCoreUI` function

### 2. Simplified the Rendering Fix
- Replaced the complex setTimeout-based rendering logic with a simpler approach
- Instead of explicitly triggering a re-render with a timeout, we now simply clear the `skipInitialRender` flag
- This allows the component renderer's existing subscription to the state manager to naturally handle the rendering
- The result is more reliable and follows the intended design pattern of the enhanced system

## Results
- Component controls (delete, move, duplicate) now work correctly
- Components continue to render properly when loaded from localStorage
- The system is more maintainable with clearer separation of concerns

## Testing
1. Test that components can be deleted by clicking the × button
2. Test that components can be moved up/down with the arrow buttons
3. Test that components can be duplicated with the ⧉ button
4. Test that components are correctly rendered when reloading the page with saved state

## Notes
This fix removes the redundant event handling system while preserving the rendering fix for localStorage-loaded components. The system now relies entirely on the component-renderer.js module for handling component controls, which is the more modern and robust approach.
