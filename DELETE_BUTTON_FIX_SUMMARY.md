# Delete Button Issue Fix Summary

## Issue Description
When deleting the last component from the media kit:
- The component was properly removed from state
- The DOM still showed 1 component after deletion
- The empty state was shown but the preview container's CSS class wasn't updated

## Root Cause
The `renderAllFromScratch` method in `component-renderer.js` was not properly managing the `has-components` CSS class on the preview container when all components were deleted.

## Fix Applied
Updated the `renderAllFromScratch` method to properly add/remove the `has-components` class:

```javascript
if (components.length > 0) {
    // Hide empty state if we have components
    emptyState.style.display = 'none';
    this.previewContainer.classList.add('has-components');  // <-- Added this line
} else {
    // Show empty state if no components
    emptyState.style.display = 'block';
    this.previewContainer.classList.remove('has-components'); // <-- Added this line
    // Setup empty state interactions
    this.setupEmptyState();
}
```

## Files Modified
- `/js/components/component-renderer.js` - Added proper class management in `renderAllFromScratch` method

## Testing
1. Add a component to the media kit
2. Delete the component using the Ã— button
3. Verify that:
   - The component is removed from the DOM
   - The empty state is displayed
   - The preview container no longer has the `has-components` class
   - The "Add Component" and "Load Template" buttons work correctly

## Additional Notes
- The delete functionality was working correctly (removing from state)
- The issue was purely a DOM rendering/CSS class management problem
- No other methods needed modification as they already handle the class properly
