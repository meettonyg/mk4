git commit -m "Fix Phase 3 validation issues

- Fixed StateValidator stats initialization to prevent undefined errors
- Implemented getStats method in SaveService
- Improved batch update handling with proper validation in EnhancedStateManager
- Added defensive programming to prevent crashes during race conditions

These fixes resolve the remaining 3 failing tests from the Phase 3 validation suite,
ensuring all 10/10 tests now pass without requiring quick fixes."
