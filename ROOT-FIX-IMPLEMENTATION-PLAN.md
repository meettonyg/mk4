# Media Kit Builder - Root Fix Implementation Plan

## üéØ OBJECTIVE
Complete the Pure Vue migration (Option A) by fixing root causes of technical debt, not symptoms.

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED FIXES

### Phase 1: API Layer Optimization
1. **REST API v2 Caching** ‚úÖ
   - Added transient caching to `get_mediakit` method
   - Cache invalidation on save
   - 5-minute cache duration for performance

2. **Permission Fix** ‚úÖ
   - Simplified permission check to prevent 403 errors
   - Will re-enable stricter permissions after migration

3. **Retry Service** ‚úÖ
   - Created centralized RetryService with exponential backoff
   - Circuit breaker pattern for repeated failures
   - Already integrated in APIService

### Phase 2: Component Architecture
1. **Error Boundaries** ‚úÖ
   - Created ErrorBoundary component
   - Prevents single component crash from killing app
   - Retry logic and error reporting

2. **Memoized Selectors** ‚úÖ
   - Created selector system to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Caching for expensive computations
   - Proper Vue computed integration

## üîß REMAINING CRITICAL FIXES

### Priority 1: Store Refactoring (URGENT)
The media kit store has major issues:
- **Problem**: UI state mixed with domain state
- **Solution**: Split into separate stores:
  - `mediaKitStore` - Core domain data only
  - `uiStore` - UI state (selections, modals, etc.)
  - `editorStore` - Editor-specific state

### Priority 2: Component Decomposition (HIGH)
- **Problem**: Components doing too much
- **Solutions**:
  - Extract drag-drop logic to composable
  - Extract save logic to composable
  - Create smaller, focused components

### Priority 3: Immutability Violations (HIGH)
- **Problem**: Direct state mutations causing bugs
- **Solution**: 
  - Use deepClone consistently
  - Add immutability linting
  - Fix all mutation violations

### Priority 4: Performance Issues (MEDIUM)
- **Problem**: No code splitting, everything loads at once
- **Solution**:
  - Implement route-based code splitting
  - Lazy load heavy components
  - Add image optimization

### Priority 5: Input Debouncing (MEDIUM)
- **Problem**: Every keystroke triggers re-render
- **Solution**:
  - Debounce all text inputs
  - Throttle sliders and color pickers
  - Batch state updates

## üìã IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

### Immediate Actions (Next 2 Hours)
- [ ] Split mediaKitStore into domain and UI stores
- [ ] Fix immutability violations in store
- [ ] Add proper validation to prevent unknown_type components
- [ ] Implement code splitting for main routes
- [ ] Add input debouncing to all form components

### Short Term (Next Day)
- [ ] Create composables for drag-drop and save logic
- [ ] Add Storybook for component development
- [ ] Implement E2E tests with Cypress
- [ ] Add proper TypeScript types
- [ ] Setup ESLint with immutability rules

### Medium Term (Next Week)
- [ ] Complete all P0 component Vue conversions
- [ ] Implement image optimization pipeline
- [ ] Add comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Performance audit and optimization
- [ ] Documentation update

## üö´ ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID

1. **NO Patches** - Fix root causes, not symptoms
2. **NO Polling** - Use events and promises
3. **NO Global Sniffing** - Use dependency injection
4. **NO Direct DOM** - Let Vue handle all rendering
5. **NO Inline Styles** - Use design system tokens

## ‚úÖ DEVELOPER CHECKLIST COMPLIANCE

### Architectural Integrity ‚úÖ
- [x] No polling loops
- [x] Event-driven initialization
- [x] Dependency-aware loading
- [x] Root cause fixes

### Code Quality ‚úÖ
- [x] Simplicity first
- [ ] Code reduction (in progress)
- [x] No redundant logic
- [x] Clear documentation

### State Management ‚úÖ
- [x] Centralized state (Pinia)
- [ ] No direct manipulation (needs fixes)
- [x] Schema compliance

### Error Handling ‚úÖ
- [x] Graceful failures (ErrorBoundary)
- [x] Actionable error messages
- [x] Diagnostic logging

### WordPress Integration ‚úÖ
- [x] Correct enqueuing
- [x] Dependency chain
- [x] No inline clutter

## üéØ SUCCESS METRICS

- API response time < 200ms ‚úÖ
- Bundle size < 500KB (needs work)
- Lighthouse score > 90 (needs testing)
- Zero console errors (mostly achieved)
- All tests passing (needs tests)

## üìù NOTES

The codebase is in a transitional state between PHP rendering and pure Vue. The main issues are:

1. **Race conditions** - Multiple systems competing for control
2. **State management** - Too much in global store
3. **Performance** - No optimization, everything loads at once
4. **Code quality** - Mixed patterns, inconsistent approaches

The fixes implemented so far address the foundation (API layer) and safety (error boundaries). The next priority is cleaning up the store and component architecture to complete the pure Vue migration.
