# 🔧 DEBUG: Theme Button Not Opening

## Issue
Theme button dispatches event but dropdown doesn't open.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Debug Logging
```javascript
// In ThemeSwitcher.vue
const handleThemeOpen = (event) => {
  console.log('🎨 ThemeSwitcher: Received open event'); // ← Added
  // ... rest of code
  toggleDropdown();
  console.log('🎨 ThemeSwitcher: Dropdown toggled, open:', dropdownOpen.value); // ← Added
};
```

### 2. Added `.prevent` to Button Click
```vue
<!-- Before -->
<button @click="handleTheme">

<!-- After -->
<button @click.prevent="handleTheme">
```

This prevents any default button behavior from interfering.

## Testing

### After Rebuild
```bash
npm run build
```

### In Browser Console
Watch for these logs when clicking Theme button:

```
✅ ThemeSwitcher: Listening for gmkb:open-theme-switcher event
🎨 Theme button clicked - event dispatched
🎨 ThemeSwitcher: Received open event       ← Should see this
🎨 ThemeSwitcher: Button position updated    ← Should see this
🎨 ThemeSwitcher: Dropdown toggled, open: true ← Should see this
```

### Manual Test
```javascript
// In console, manually trigger the event:
document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('gmkb:open-theme-switcher'));

// Should see the dropdown open
```

## What To Look For

### If You See:
✅ "Received open event" → Event listener is working
✅ "Dropdown toggled, open: true" → Toggle function is working
✅ Dropdown appears → Everything is working!

### If You Don't See:
❌ "Received open event" → Event listener not attached
❌ "Dropdown toggled" → Toggle function not being called
❌ Dropdown doesn't appear → Check CSS or positioning

## Next Steps

1. Build: `npm run build`
2. Refresh page
3. Click Theme button
4. Check console for debug logs
5. Check if dropdown appears
