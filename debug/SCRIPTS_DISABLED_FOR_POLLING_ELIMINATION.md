# DEBUG SCRIPTS DISABLED

All debug scripts in this directory have been disabled to eliminate polling race conditions.

The following scripts were creating polling functions that caused timeout errors:
- comprehensive-polling-detector.js (anti-polling system creating its own polling)
- root-level-polling-eliminator.js (polling elimination using setTimeout)
- mkcg-auto-load-diagnostic.js (diagnostic polling)

These scripts are preserved but disabled. To re-enable for debugging:
1. Rename this file to something else
2. Clear all browser and WordPress caches
3. Use with extreme caution as they may reintroduce race conditions

ROOT FIX: All polling eliminated - bundles now handle coordination without any debug overhead.
