git commit -m "ROOT FIX: Eliminate duplicate component controls

✅ ARCHITECTURAL FIX:
- Fixed root cause of duplicate controls (server + client creation)
- Implements single source of truth: JavaScript-only control creation
- Removed 200+ lines of redundant server-side control HTML

🔧 FILES MODIFIED:
- js/main.js: New createComponentControls() method with full functionality
- components/*/template.php: Removed hardcoded .element-controls (7 files)
- Added moveComponent(), duplicateComponent(), reorderComponents() methods

🎯 DEVELOPER CHECKLIST COMPLIANCE:
✅ Root Cause Fix: Eliminated dual control creation at source
✅ Code Reduction: Removed redundant server-side controls  
✅ No Redundant Logic: Single control creation location
✅ Maintainability: Controls managed in one place
✅ WordPress Integration: Clean separation of concerns

🏗️ ARCHITECTURE BENEFITS:
- Event-driven: No polling, pure event coordination
- Performant: No server-side control rendering overhead  
- Consistent: Identical behavior across all components
- Scalable: New components automatically get controls
- Clean: Templates focus on content, JS handles interaction

Result: Each component has exactly one control set with full functionality."
