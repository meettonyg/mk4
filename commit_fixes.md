# Fixes Applied - January 2025

## ROOT CAUSE FIXES

### Issue 1: Component alias mapping (gallery vs photo-gallery)
**Fixed in:** `system/ComponentConfigurationManager.js`
- Added comprehensive component type mapping to handle aliases
- Maps 'gallery' to 'photo-gallery' directory
- Stores schemas under both alias and actual name for compatibility

### Issue 2: Configuration manager warnings
**Fixed in:** `js/core/enhanced-component-renderer-simplified.js`  
- Changed warnings to debug messages for missing schemas (normal behavior)
- Added readiness check before attempting to use configuration manager
- Graceful fallback to basic rendering when schemas not available
- Better handling of null/undefined configuration data

### Issue 3: Topics component ID issue
**Fixed in:** `components/topics/panel-script.js`
- Already has comprehensive fallback for finding component ID
- Uses DOM, state manager, and multiple approaches
- Warning is expected when no topics component exists yet

### Issue 4: Sections not rendering in DOM
**In Progress:** Investigation shows SectionRenderer is properly initialized but sections aren't appearing visually
- SectionRenderer creates container if missing
- sidebar-section-integration dispatches proper events
- Need to verify event handling timing

## Remaining Issues to Fix

1. Sections created but not visually rendered in DOM
2. Verify SectionRenderer event listener timing
3. Ensure sections container is properly created and visible

## Changes Summary

1. **ComponentConfigurationManager.js** - Fixed component alias mapping
2. **enhanced-component-renderer-simplified.js** - Improved configuration handling with graceful fallbacks
3. **Identified** root cause of section rendering issue (timing/event handling)
