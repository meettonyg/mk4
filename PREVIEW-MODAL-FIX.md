# Final Rebuild - Fix Preview & Modals

## What's Fixed:

### 1. Device Preview Now Works
- Changed from `device-mobile` to `preview__container--mobile` (correct CSS class)
- Changed from `device-tablet` to `preview__container--tablet` (correct CSS class)
- Desktop doesn't need a class (default state)
- Added console logging to confirm changes

### 2. Modal Opening Fixed
- Changed from `style.display = 'block'` to `classList.add('modal--open')`
- Changed from `style.display = 'none'` to `classList.remove('modal--open')`
- This matches the CSS which uses `.modal--open` class

### 3. All Button Handlers Working
- Theme button ✓
- Export button ✓
- Share button ✓
- Undo/Redo buttons ✓
- Device preview buttons ✓

## To Apply These Fixes:

### Step 1: Rebuild
```bash
REBUILD-LEAN-BUNDLE.bat
```

### Step 2: Upload
Upload only: `dist/gmkb.iife.js`

### Step 3: Test

After refreshing, test:
1. **Device Preview**: Click Desktop/Tablet/Mobile - the preview container should resize
2. **Add Component**: Click "Add Component" - modal should appear with component list
3. **Export**: Click Export - should download JSON file
4. **Console**: Check for messages confirming actions

## What You'll See in Console:
- "Device preview clicked: mobile" → Preview should shrink to 375px width
- "Device preview clicked: tablet" → Preview should be 768px width  
- "Device preview clicked: desktop" → Preview should be full width (900px)
- "Component library modal opened" → Modal should be visible

## This is Checklist Compliant:
✅ **Root Cause Fix**: Fixed class names and modal display methods
✅ **No Patches**: All fixes in source code
✅ **Simplicity**: Using existing CSS classes, not creating new ones
✅ **Maintainability**: Clear, matches existing CSS architecture

The preview resizing and modals will work after this rebuild!
