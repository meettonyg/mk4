refactor(sections): Remove redundant footer from SectionEditor (Cancel/Apply buttons)

PROBLEM:
- Section Editor had Cancel and Apply Changes buttons
- All changes already applied live via updateSetting()
- Apply Changes button was redundant (re-saving already-saved data)
- Cancel button was misleading (couldn't revert changes, no backup exists)
- Footer contradicted live-update UX pattern

ROOT CAUSE:
- Legacy pattern from non-live-updating version
- handleSave() just duplicated what updateSetting() already did
- No undo/redo system to support "Cancel" functionality

SOLUTION:
- Removed footer HTML with Cancel/Apply buttons
- Removed handleSave() function (redundant logic)
- Removed ~60 lines of footer CSS
- Kept handleBack() for back button in header

RESULT:
- Cleaner UI matching Elementor-style live editing
- Honest UX - interface matches behavior
- Code reduction: ~78 lines removed
- Settings apply immediately, back button just closes panel
- Auto-save handles persistence

Files modified:
- src/vue/components/sidebar/SectionEditor.vue

Testing:
- All settings changes apply immediately to preview
- Back button closes editor and changes persist
- No console errors, clean functionality

Developer Checklist Compliance:
✅ Code Reduction - Net deletion of 78 lines
✅ No Redundant Logic - Eliminated duplicate save
✅ Simplicity First - Removed unnecessary complexity
✅ Maintainability - Clearer component purpose
