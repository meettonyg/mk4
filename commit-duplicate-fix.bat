git commit -m "ROOT FIX: Resolve duplicate component rendering and missing controls

PROBLEMS FIXED:
1. Duplicate component rendering from multiple renderers
2. Missing component controls after rendering
3. Component controls not appearing on hover
4. Multiple renderer conflicts (ClientOnlyRenderer vs SimplifiedComponentRenderer)

SOLUTIONS IMPLEMENTED:
1. Enhanced SimplifiedComponentRenderer to:
   - Remove duplicate components before rendering
   - Explicitly attach controls after rendering
   - Request control attachment for all components in sections

2. Modified ClientOnlyRenderer to:
   - Check if enhanced renderer exists before initializing
   - Prevent duplicate renderer conflicts

3. Updated SectionRenderer to:
   - Request control attachment for existing components
   - Prevent duplicate rendering passes

4. Created diagnostic and fix script:
   - Diagnoses duplicate rendering issues
   - Automatically removes duplicates
   - Attaches missing controls
   - Monitors for new duplicates

EXPECTED RESULTS:
- Components render only once
- Controls appear on all components
- Hover behavior works correctly
- No duplicate renderers active

TESTING:
Run diagnoseDuplicateRendering() in console to verify fixes
Run fixDuplicatesAndControls() to apply fixes manually
Auto-fix runs on page load"
