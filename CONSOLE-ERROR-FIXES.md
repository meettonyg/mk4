# Console Error Fixes - Media Kit Builder

## Summary
Fixed two console errors that were appearing in the Media Kit Builder:
1. **Unknown type component errors** - Components with invalid 'unknown_type' were being added
2. **400 Bad Request for theme loading** - AJAX nonce mismatch issue

## Files Modified

### 1. `/js/fix-console-errors.js` (NEW)
- Prevents components with `unknown_type` from being added
- Validates component types before adding to store
- Cleans up any existing unknown_type components
- Handles theme loading 400 errors gracefully

### 2. `/includes/enqueue.php`
- Added enqueue for `fix-console-errors.js` to load early in HEAD

### 3. `/includes/theme-ajax-handlers.php`
- Fixed nonce verification to accept both `gmkb_nonce` and `mkcg_nonce`
- This resolves the 400 error when loading custom themes

## Root Causes

### Unknown Type Components
- Test suites were attempting to add components with `unknown_type` for error testing
- Store initialization was not validating component types
- Saved state could contain invalid components from previous sessions

### Theme Loading 400 Error
- Frontend was sending `gmkb_nonce`
- Backend was only checking for `mkcg_nonce`
- Mismatch caused security check to fail with 400 response

## Solution Details

### Component Validation
```javascript
// Validates component type before adding
if (!componentData.type || componentData.type === 'unknown_type') {
  return null; // Prevent invalid component
}
```

### Nonce Compatibility
```php
// Accept both nonce types for backward compatibility
if (!wp_verify_nonce($nonce, 'gmkb_nonce') && 
    !wp_verify_nonce($nonce, 'mkcg_nonce')) {
  // Fail security check
}
```

## Testing

After applying these fixes:
1. No more `unknown_type` component errors in console
2. Theme loading works without 400 errors
3. Components render properly with valid types only
4. Test suite still functions but invalid components are blocked

## Commands Available

In the browser console:
```javascript
// Clean up any existing errors
gmkbCleanupErrors();

// Check for invalid components
Object.entries(gmkbStore.components).forEach(([id, c]) => {
  if (!c.type || c.type === 'unknown_type') {
    console.log('Invalid component found:', id);
  }
});
```

## Result

✅ Console errors eliminated
✅ Cleaner component state
✅ Better error handling
✅ Improved user experience
