git commit -m "ðŸ§¹ ROOT FIX: Overlapping/Stacking Component Controls Fixed

CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED:
- Fixed overlapping component controls shown in screenshot
- Multiple control sets were stacking on same component
- Aggressive deduplication implemented to prevent overlaps

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
- Emergency controls system conflicting with main controls
- Insufficient deduplication checking
- Multiple attachment attempts without proper cleanup
- Stale tracker data causing attachment bypassing

ARCHITECTURAL FIXES:
âœ… Aggressive control deduplication (removes ALL existing before new)
âœ… Processing flag prevents simultaneous attachments
âœ… Emergency controls system completely removed
âœ… Proper cleanup of stale tracker data and event listeners
âœ… Clean slate approach for every attachment

DEDUPLICATION IMPROVEMENTS:
- Remove ALL control containers (.component-controls, .emergency-controls)
- Clear tracking data and event listeners
- Remove control-related attributes
- Processing flag prevents race conditions
- Success/error handling with proper cleanup

REMOVALS (Sources of Conflict):
- Emergency controls fallback system (main.js)
- Duplicate control attachment logic
- Conflicting hover behaviors
- Stale event listener accumulation

CHECKLIST COMPLIANCE:
âœ… Root Cause Fix (aggressive deduplication)
âœ… No Polling (event-driven architecture maintained)
âœ… Remove Fallbacks/Patches (emergency system removed)
âœ… Simplicity First (clean single-system approach)
âœ… Code Quality (proper cleanup and state management)

FILES MODIFIED:
- js/core/component-controls-manager.js (aggressive deduplication)
- js/main.js (removed emergency controls system)
- debug/test-overlapping-controls-fix.js (verification script)

RESULT: Single clean control set per component, no overlapping/stacking"
