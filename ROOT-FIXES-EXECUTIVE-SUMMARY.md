## 🔬 Fix Philosophy

Every fix followed these principles from the migration plan:

### ✅ Root Cause, Not Symptoms
- Export toggles: Fixed parameter passing, not UI state
- Import mode: Fixed data forwarding, not modal logic
- Theme fallback: Fixed validation, not hard-coded values
- Columns: Fixed logic, not workarounds

### ✅ No Polling or Timeouts
- Event-driven modal system (gmkb:open-export, gmkb:open-import)
- Computed properties for synchronization (theme dropdown)
- Proper Vue reactivity (no manual watchers)

### ✅ Proper Cleanup
- Added onBeforeUnmount hooks
- Stored handler references for removal
- No memory leaks

### ✅ Single Source of Truth
- Pinia store for theme state
- ComponentRegistry for component metadata
- No duplicate state management

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Automated Tests
Run `verify-root-fixes.js` in browser console:
```javascript
verifyRootFixes()
```

Expected output:
- ✅ 5-7 automatic checks passed
- ⚠️ 3-5 manual tests required
- ❌ 0 failures

### Manual Tests (5 minutes)

**Export/Import (Issues #1, #2, #8)**
1. Click Settings → "Export Media Kit" → Should open on Export tab
2. Toggle "Include Theme Settings" OFF → Export → Verify theme NOT in file
3. Toggle "Include Pods Data" OFF → Export → Verify pods NOT in file
4. Click Settings → "Import Media Kit" → Should open on Import tab
5. Select "Merge" mode → Import → Should ADD to existing components
6. Select "Replace" mode → Import → Should CLEAR then import

**Theme Management (Issues #3, #9)**
1. Open Theme Customizer → Should not error, valid theme shown
2. Change theme in toolbar → Settings dropdown updates
3. Change theme in settings → Toolbar reflects change
4. Change theme in customizer → All UI elements sync

**Component Management (Issues #4, #5, #7)**
1. Open sidebar → All components show friendly names (not slugs)
2. Look for "Topics & Questions" → Should be listed
3. Add component to 2-column section → Verify correct column placement
4. Create 3-column section → Verify components stay in assigned columns

**Memory/Performance (Issue #10)**
1. Open DevTools → Memory tab
2. Open/close sidebar 10 times
3. Take heap snapshot → Should not show growing listeners
4. Use app for 5 minutes → No console errors
