# THIS FILE HAS BEEN REMOVED
# Use the dynamic registry at: src/services/UnifiedComponentRegistry.js

This static registry was replaced by the dynamic registry which:
- Loads definitions from WordPress ComponentDiscovery
- Uses import.meta.glob for proper Vite bundling  
- Supports runtime component registration
- Provides better error handling

All imports should now use:
```javascript
import UnifiedComponentRegistry from '../services/UnifiedComponentRegistry.js';
```

**File removed in**: Round 4 cleanup (2025-01-14)
**Reason**: Duplicate implementation causing bundle bloat
