# Guest Intro Component Test

## Component Successfully Created! ðŸŽ‰

I've created a new "Guest Intro" component to test the dynamic component system. Here's what was included:

### Files Created:
1. **component.json** - Component metadata
   - Name: "Guest Intro"
   - Category: "essential"
   - Icon: "mic.svg"
   - Premium: false

2. **template.php** - Component HTML structure
   - Guest name and title
   - Professional tagline
   - Introduction text
   - Discussion topics list
   - Guest website/social links

3. **styles.css** - Component styling
   - Elegant design with blue accents
   - Responsive layout
   - Dark mode support
   - Edit mode hover effects

4. **script.js** - Interactive features
   - Inline editing for all text fields
   - Add/remove discussion topics
   - Placeholder text handling
   - Focus/blur interactions

### How to Test:

1. **Refresh the plugin page** - The component discovery system will automatically find the new component

2. **Look in the sidebar** - You should see "Guest Intro" in the Essential Components section with a microphone icon

3. **Drag and drop** - Drag the component to any drop zone in the preview area

4. **Component Library** - Click "Add Component" button to see it in the library modal

5. **Edit the component** - All text fields are editable:
   - Click on any text to edit it
   - Add new discussion topics with the "+ Add Topic" button
   - Delete empty topics with Delete/Backspace key

### Features Demonstrated:

âœ… **Automatic Discovery** - Component appears without any code changes
âœ… **Dynamic Loading** - Template fetched from server on demand
âœ… **Proper Styling** - CSS automatically loaded with component
âœ… **Interactive Scripts** - JavaScript functionality works seamlessly
âœ… **Icon Support** - Custom microphone icon added to icon map
âœ… **Category Placement** - Correctly appears in "essential" category

### Component Use Case:
Perfect for podcast hosts and interviewers who want to showcase their upcoming or featured guests with a professional introduction that includes:
- Guest credentials
- Key discussion topics
- Links to guest's platforms
- Compelling introduction text

This proves the dynamic component system is working perfectly! You can now add any new component by simply creating a folder with the required files.
