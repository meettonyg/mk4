Implemented dynamic component system integration - Phase 1-3 complete

## Summary

I've successfully integrated the dynamic component system into your media kit builder. Here's what was accomplished:

### Phase 1: Backend Integration ✓
1. **Main Plugin File Updates**:
   - Integrated ComponentDiscovery, ComponentLoader, and DesignPanel classes
   - Added REST API endpoints for component operations
   - Added AJAX handlers for backwards compatibility
   - Component data is now loaded from the filesystem

2. **Data Localization**:
   - Component data is passed to frontend via `wp_localize_script`
   - All component metadata is available in `guestifyData.components` and `guestifyData.categories`

### Phase 2: Dynamic Component UI ✓
1. **Dynamic Component Loader**:
   - Created `dynamic-component-loader.js` module
   - Components are rendered by fetching templates from the server
   - Automatic addition of editing controls and contenteditable attributes

2. **Sidebar Components**:
   - `initializeDynamicComponents()` dynamically populates the component sidebar
   - Components are organized by category with proper icons and styling

3. **Component Library Modal**:
   - Modal is now populated dynamically from component data
   - Event delegation handles clicks on dynamically created elements

### Phase 3: Overhauled Rendering Logic ✓
1. **Async Component Loading**:
   - `addComponentToZone()` is now async and fetches templates from server
   - Added loading states and error handling
   - Proper CSS for loading spinners and error messages

2. **Component Mapping**:
   - Added mapping between old component names (bio, cta) and new directory names
   - Ensures backward compatibility

3. **Updated Templates**:
   - Fixed component templates to have proper structure
   - Added data attributes for component identification
   - Proper WordPress escaping functions for security

### Technical Improvements:
- **Performance**: Components are loaded on-demand, reducing initial payload
- **Flexibility**: New components can be added by simply creating a new folder
- **Maintainability**: No more hardcoded HTML in JavaScript
- **Security**: Proper sanitization and escaping in PHP templates

### What's Working:
- ✅ Components load dynamically from the server
- ✅ Drag and drop works with dynamic components
- ✅ Component library modal shows all available components
- ✅ Loading states provide visual feedback
- ✅ Error handling for failed component loads
- ✅ Backward compatibility with existing component names

### Next Steps (Phase 4):
The foundation is now in place. Phase 4 would involve:
1. Creating component-specific design panels
2. Loading design settings dynamically based on selected component
3. Implementing component-specific configuration options

The system is now fully dynamic and extensible. You can add new components by creating a folder in the `components` directory with the required files (component.json, template.php, styles.css, script.js).
