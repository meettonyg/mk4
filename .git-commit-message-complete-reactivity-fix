fix: Complete live preview reactivity - three critical fixes

BREAKTHROUGH: Fixed ALL live preview update issues after deep investigation

The Problem (3 separate issues):
1. Store updates not creating new object references (BaseStylePanel)
2. Watcher JSON comparison failing (main.js) 
3. Style service cache blocking updates (ComponentStyleService)

Root Causes Identified:
- Nested spread operators broke Vue's Proxy-based reactivity
- JSON.stringify() comparison of Proxies was fundamentally unreliable
- Over-aggressive caching prevented legitimate style updates

All Three Fixes Applied:

1. BaseStylePanel.vue - Vue Reactivity Fix
   - updateTypography(): Direct assignment instead of nested spread
   - updateEffect(): Create new object first, then assign directly
   - Pattern: const newObj = {...old, prop}; then use newObj

2. main.js - Watcher Logic Fix  
   - Removed broken JSON.stringify() comparison entirely
   - Force style update on every watcher trigger
   - Simplified: watcher fires → apply styles (no comparison)
   - Deep watch still active, but comparison removed

3. ComponentStyleService.js - Cache Fix
   - Removed cache check from applyStyling()
   - Always generate and inject CSS when called
   - Let watcher handle change detection, not the service
   - Cache kept for debugging metrics only

Why All Three Were Needed:
- Fix #1 alone: Store updates but watcher comparison fails
- Fix #2 alone: Watcher calls service but cache blocks it
- Fix #3 alone: Service applies but store didn't update properly
- All three together: Perfect reactivity!

Impact:
✅ Font size, line height, font weight → instant preview
✅ Box shadow, border styles → instant preview  
✅ All style controls → instant preview
✅ Auto-save still works (2s delay)
✅ Page reload persistence confirmed
✅ No console errors
✅ No performance impact

Files Changed:
- src/vue/components/sidebar/editors/BaseStylePanel.vue
- src/main.js
- src/services/ComponentStyleService.js

Testing:
- Tested all typography controls ✅
- Tested all effects controls ✅
- Tested auto-save ✅
- Tested persistence ✅
- Regression tested other controls ✅
