# Delete Button Debug Instructions

## How to Debug

1. **Load the enhanced debug script:**
   ```javascript
   const script = document.createElement('script');
   script.src = 'debug-delete-enhanced.js';
   document.head.appendChild(script);
   ```

2. **Run the test script:**
   ```javascript
   const script = document.createElement('script');
   script.src = 'test-delete-action.js';
   document.head.appendChild(script);
   ```

3. **Manually test:**
   - Click the delete button (×) on any component
   - Watch the console for debug output
   - Note which case is triggered (DELETE or DUPLICATE)

## What to Look For

1. **Button Properties:**
   - Is the title "Delete"?
   - Is the textContent "×"?
   - What is the finalAction value?

2. **Event Flow:**
   - How many click handlers fire?
   - Which case in the switch statement is triggered?
   - Is duplicateComponent called when it shouldn't be?

3. **State Changes:**
   - Number of components before click
   - Number of components after click
   - Does the component get removed from state?

## Current Debug Logs Added

1. **Component Renderer (`setupComponentInteractivity`):**
   - Logs when setting up interactivity
   - Logs all button properties when clicked
   - Logs the final action to execute
   - Logs which case is triggered

2. **Component Manager (`duplicateComponent`):**
   - Logs when duplicate is called
   - Shows call stack to trace where it's called from

3. **State Manager (`removeComponent`):**
   - Logs when remove is called
   - Shows which component is being removed

## Send Me This Info

After running the debug scripts and clicking a delete button, please send:
1. The complete console output
2. Which browser you're using
3. Any errors that appear

This will help identify the exact point where delete is triggering duplicate.
