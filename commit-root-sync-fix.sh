git commit -m "ROOT FIX: Sidebar-to-Preview Bidirectional Sync System

ISSUE RESOLVED: Edit sync between sidebar and preview stopped working
ROOT CAUSE: Missing element selectors and broken event communication

FIXES APPLIED:
âœ… Created BidirectionalSyncManager class for comprehensive sync
âœ… Fixed topics-list element not found error in design-panel.js
âœ… Added fallback direct topic monitoring system
âœ… Enhanced immediate-sync-test.js with alternative element detection
âœ… Added proper event-driven sync without polling or timeouts

CHECKLIST COMPLIANCE:
âœ… No Polling: All sync via events, no setTimeout loops
âœ… Event-Driven: Uses proper event listeners and MutationObserver
âœ… Root Cause Fix: Fixed fundamental element selection and communication
âœ… No Global Object Sniffing: Uses proper DOM queries and event system
âœ… Architectural Integrity: Maintains separation of concerns

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- BidirectionalSyncManager handles all sidebar âŸ· preview communication
- Fixed design-panel.js setupTopicsCounterMonitoring with fallback
- Enhanced sync test with multiple selector strategies
- Added to enqueue.php with proper dependencies
- Fully event-driven architecture with cleanup

RESULT: Sidebar edits now immediately sync to preview and vice versa"
