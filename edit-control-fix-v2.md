# Fixed Edit Control Issues

## Problems Found and Fixed:

1. **Duplicate Controls**: Both ComponentWrapper and ComponentRenderer were showing controls, creating duplicate control buttons
   - Fixed by passing `:show-controls="false"` to ComponentRenderer from ComponentWrapper

2. **Wrong Edit Method**: ComponentRenderer was dispatching a window event instead of calling the store's openEditPanel
   - Fixed by changing to `store.openEditPanel(props.component.id)`

## Architecture:
```
ComponentWrapper (handles controls) 
  └── ComponentRenderer (renders component without controls)
       └── Actual Component (BiographyRenderer, etc.)
```

## Build and Test:
```bash
npm run build
```

Then refresh the page and test:
1. Hover over a component - you should see ONE set of controls
2. Click the Edit (✏️) button
3. Edit panel should slide in from the right
