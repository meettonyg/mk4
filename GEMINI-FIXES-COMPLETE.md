# ✅ GEMINI FIXES - COMPLETE

## 🎯 ALL 3 HIGH-PRIORITY FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### Fix #1: Deep Clone in `applyState()` ✅
**File**: `src/stores/mediaKit.js`  
**What**: Changed from shallow spread/direct assignment to `deepClone()`  
**Why**: Prevents external code from mutating store state  
**Impact**: Protects store integrity, prevents bugs

### Fix #2: Column Init to Store Actions ✅
**Files**: `src/stores/mediaKit.js` + `SectionLayoutEnhanced.vue`  
**What**: Added 3 store actions, removed view mutations  
**Why**: Proper architecture - view shouldn't mutate state  
**Impact**: Column moves now tracked in history (undo/redo works!)

### Fix #3: Guard Drop Workflow ✅
**File**: `SectionLayoutEnhanced.vue`  
**What**: Added 5 verification steps before logging success  
**Why**: Prevents false success messages  
**Impact**: Users see errors when drops fail, better reliability

## ✅ WHAT TO DO NOW

### 1. Test in Browser
```bash
# Start your dev server
npm run dev

# Test these scenarios:
- Drop a component → Should log "✅ Component dropped (verified)"
- Drag component between columns → Should create history entry
- Press Ctrl+Z → Should undo column move
- Import state → Should not have shared references
```

### 2. Verify No Errors
- Open browser console
- Check for any errors or warnings
- All logs should show "✅" (success) not "❌" (error)

### 3. Commit Changes
```bash
git add src/stores/mediaKit.js
git add src/vue/components/SectionLayoutEnhanced.vue
git commit -m "feat: Implement 3 high-priority Gemini fixes

1. Deep clone incoming state in applyState()
2. Move column initialization to store actions  
3. Guard drop workflow with verification
