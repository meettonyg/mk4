# Media Kit Builder - Save Fix Instructions

## Problem Identified
Components were not persisting after page refresh. The debug output showed:
- Components existed in JavaScript state
- But `components_count: 0` when saved to database
- Components were lost on page refresh

## Root Cause
The save function in `src/main.js` was incorrectly rebuilding the components object:
1. It started with an empty components object `{}`
2. Then tried to rebuild it with "safe" properties
3. This rebuilding process was losing all components

## Fix Applied
Updated `src/main.js` to:
1. Use the actual components from state instead of starting with empty object
2. Only clean up problematic Vue internal properties
3. Keep all component data intact

## How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Rebuild the JavaScript Bundle
Run the rebuild script to compile the changes:
```bash
cd C:\Users\seoge\OneDrive\Desktop\CODE-Guestify\MEDIAKIT\PLUGIN\mk4
rebuild.bat
```

Or manually run:
```bash
npm run build
```

### Step 2: Test the Fix

1. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+Shift+R) to ensure new bundle loads

2. **Add a component** (e.g., biography)

3. **Open browser console** and run:
```javascript
// Check what's being saved
testSaveFix()
```
   - Should show `components_count: 1` (not 0)

4. **Refresh the page**

5. **Check persistence**:
```javascript
// Verify components loaded
verifyPersistence()
```
   - Should show components loaded from database

## Additional Debug Tools

### 1. Database Inspector
Check what's actually saved in the database:
```javascript
inspectDatabaseState()
```

### 2. Debug Commands
```javascript
// Show current state
debugGMKB.showState()

// Show components map
debugGMKB.showComponents()

// Show sections
debugGMKB.showSections()

// Get server logs
await debugGMKB.getLogs()
```

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] Bundle rebuilt with `npm run build`
- [ ] Browser cache cleared
- [ ] Component added successfully
- [ ] Save shows correct `components_count` (not 0)
- [ ] Components persist after page refresh
- [ ] Components appear in correct sections

## Files Modified
1. `/src/main.js` - Fixed save function to preserve components
2. `/includes/gmkb-ajax-handlers.php` - Enhanced component counting
3. `/includes/gmkb-debug-logger.php` - Added logging
4. `/includes/gmkb-database-inspector.php` - Added inspection tool

## If Fix Doesn't Work
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Run `inspectDatabaseState()` to see what's in database
3. Check PHP error logs for server-side issues
4. Ensure bundle was rebuilt successfully

## Success Indicators
- ✅ `components_count` matches actual component count when saving
- ✅ Components visible after page refresh
- ✅ `verifyPersistence()` shows components loaded
- ✅ No console errors during save/load
