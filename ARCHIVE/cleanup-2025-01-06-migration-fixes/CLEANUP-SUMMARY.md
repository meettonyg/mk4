2. **fix-registry.bat** - Script for building with unified component registry
3. **fix-vue-data-bridge.bat** - Script for fixing Vue component data bridge
4. **test-build.bat** - Simple build testing script
5. **repair-state.php** - PHP script for repairing orphaned components in state

## Files NOT Archived

### Kept for Production Use
- **build.bat** - Main build script (still needed)
- **clean-install-build.bat** - Clean installation script (useful for fresh setups)
- **clean-rebuild.bat** - Clean rebuild script (useful for troubleshooting)
- **deploy.ps1 / deploy.sh** - Deployment scripts (needed for production)

### Kept for Development
- **/tests/state-manager-tests.js** - Legitimate test suite for state management
- All documentation in **/docs/** - Still relevant for developers

## Verification Status

✅ **Confirmed Removed:**
- Old `src/vue/components/renderers/` directory was already deleted
- No references to archived files in active code

✅ **Build Still Works:**
- Main build process uses `npm run build` via build.bat
- No dependencies on archived scripts

## Next Steps

1. Run `npm run build` to verify everything still works
2. Commit these changes with message: "chore: archive migration and debug scripts"
3. Continue with Phase 1 implementation as per the continuation plan
