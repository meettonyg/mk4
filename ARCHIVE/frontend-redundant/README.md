# Frontend Redundant Files Archive

## Date: Current
## Reason: Redundant implementation - frontend rendering already works through theme integration

## Files Archived:

### 1. `class-frontend-renderer.php`
- **Location**: Was in `includes/`
- **Purpose**: Was created to handle frontend rendering with shortcodes
- **Why Redundant**: The existing system already handles frontend rendering automatically through:
  - Theme's `single-guests.php` checks for media kit data
  - Plugin's `single-guests-mediakit-fallback.php` template renders components
  - No shortcodes needed - automatic on guest posts

### 2. `frontend-mediakit.js`
- **Location**: Was in `js/`
- **Purpose**: JavaScript for interactive frontend features
- **Why Redundant**: Not referenced or needed by the existing template
- **Note**: Could be re-added later if interactive features are needed

### 3. `test-frontend-rendering.php`
- **Location**: Was in root directory
- **Purpose**: Test file for the redundant frontend renderer
- **Why Redundant**: Tests a system that isn't being used

## Files KEPT (Still in use):

### 1. `css/frontend-mediakit.css`
- **Status**: ACTIVE - Referenced by `single-guests-mediakit-fallback.php`
- **Purpose**: Styles for frontend media kit display

### 2. `css/modules/components.css`
- **Status**: ACTIVE - Referenced by `single-guests-mediakit-fallback.php`
- **Purpose**: Component-specific styles for frontend

## How Frontend Rendering Actually Works:

1. **Theme Integration** (`themes/guestify/g-theme/guestify/single-guests.php`):
   ```php
   // Checks for media kit data at the top
   $media_kit_state = get_post_meta($post->ID, 'gmkb_media_kit_state', true);
   
   // If found, includes plugin template
   include $plugin_template; // single-guests-mediakit-fallback.php
   exit;
   ```

2. **Plugin Template** (`templates/single-guests-mediakit-fallback.php`):
   - Loads saved components from `gmkb_media_kit_state` meta
   - Renders sections if they exist
   - Falls back to simple component list if no sections
   - Uses component templates from `components/{type}/template.php`

3. **No Additional Code Needed**:
   - Works automatically when viewing guest posts
   - No shortcodes required
   - No additional PHP classes needed
   - CSS files are properly loaded by the template

## To Restore if Needed:

All files are preserved in this archive directory and can be restored if the implementation changes or if shortcode-based rendering is needed in the future.
