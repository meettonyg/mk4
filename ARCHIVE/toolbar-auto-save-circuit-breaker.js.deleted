/**
 * DELETED: This was a problematic patch that violated the project checklist
 * 
 * VIOLATIONS:
 * - Used setInterval polling (Phase 1 violation)  
 * - Patched symptoms instead of root cause (Phase 1 violation)
 * - Added 150+ lines of complex code instead of simple fix (Phase 2 violation)

 * 
 * ROOT CAUSE FIX IMPLEMENTED INSTEAD:
 * - Added missing gmkb.js to enqueue.php
 * - GMKB system now loads properly, eliminating need for circuit breaker
 * - Event-driven initialization works correctly
 * 
 * DELETED: 2024-08-26 - Replaced with proper root cause fix
