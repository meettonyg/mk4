## Why These Were Archived

**Investigation showed:**
- None of these files were imported anywhere in the codebase
- They were leftover from incomplete Vue migration
- DragDropManager was actively causing bugs (duplicate components)
- All functionality already exists in Pinia store + Vue components

**Search Results:**
```bash
grep -r "EnhancedStateManager" src/     # No imports found
grep -r "HistoryManager" src/            # No imports found
grep -r "DragDropManager" src/           # Only in old main.js
grep -r "ImportExportManager" src/       # Only in old main.js
```

## What Replaced Them

**Pinia Store** (src/stores/mediaKit.js):
- ✅ State management
- ✅ Component CRUD operations
- ✅ Section management
- ✅ Undo/redo functionality
- ✅ Persistence (localStorage + WordPress)
- ✅ Orphaned component detection/fixing

**Vue Components**:
- ✅ All UI rendering
- ✅ Drag and drop (SectionLayoutEnhanced.vue)
- ✅ Import/Export (ImportExportModal.vue)
- ✅ All user interactions

**Utility Services**:
- ✅ APIService.js - REST API communication
- ✅ UnifiedComponentRegistry.js - Component metadata
- ✅ ImportExportService.js - Import/export logic

---

## Recovery

If you need to restore these files (unlikely):

```bash
# Copy back from archive
cp ARCHIVE/legacy-js-20250602/EnhancedStateManager.js src/core/
cp ARCHIVE/legacy-js-20250602/main.js.OLD src/main.js
# etc...
```

---

## Bugs Fixed by This Cleanup

1. **Duplicate Components Bug** ✅
   - DragDropManager was adding components
   - Vue SectionLayoutEnhanced was also adding components
   - Result: Components added twice
   - Fix: Removed DragDropManager, Vue is now single source of truth

2. **403 Forbidden Errors** ✅
   - WordPress REST API nonce expiring
   - Fix: Enhanced nonce bypass in class-gmkb-rest-api-v2.php

3. **Redo Button Not Working** ✅
   - Undo/redo polluting history stack
   - Fix: Added _isUndoRedoOperation flag in Pinia store

## Architecture Now

**100% Vue.js SPA**:
- Vue components handle ALL UI
- Pinia store handles ALL state
- No competing JavaScript systems
- Clean, predictable architecture
