# mkcgDataMapper Registration Fix

## Problem Identified
As correctly analyzed by Gemini AI, the root cause of the initialization failure was:

1. **`enhanced-system-registrar.js`** was trying to register `mkcgDataMapper` as a core system
2. **`system-registrar.js`** didn't recognize `mkcgDataMapper` as a valid system name
3. This caused the registration to fail with "Unknown system registration attempted: mkcgDataMapper"
4. Since only 7 systems were registered instead of the expected 8, the initialization failed

## Solution Applied
Added `mkcgDataMapper` to the list of valid systems in `system-registrar.js`:

### Changes Made:
1. **Added to systems object** (line ~28):
   ```javascript
   // PHASE 2.1: MKCG data mapper for component data integration
   mkcgDataMapper: null,
   ```

2. **Added to core system validation** (line ~81):
   - Included in the list of systems that need method validation

3. **Added expected methods** (line ~154):
   ```javascript
   mkcgDataMapper: ['mapDataToComponent', 'getDataAvailability']
   ```

4. **Updated core system lists**:
   - `isCore` check (line ~133)
   - `coreSystemCount` (line ~177)
   - `areCoreSytemsReady` (line ~205)

## Result
Now `mkcgDataMapper` is recognized as a valid core system and can be registered without errors.

## How to Verify
1. **Refresh the page** to load with the fix
2. **Run the test script** in browser console:
   ```javascript
   // Copy the contents of console-test-mkcg-fix.js
   ```

3. **Check for successful registration**:
   - mkcgDataMapper should be in the valid systems list
   - Core systems count should be 8/8
   - No "Unknown system registration" warnings

## Next Steps
After the page loads successfully:
1. Run `emergencyDiagnostic()` to check system health
2. Run `await testAllFixes()` to verify all previous fixes
3. Run `await comprehensivePhase23TestRunner()` to run the full test suite
