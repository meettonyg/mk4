git commit -m "ðŸ”§ PHASE 2: Fix System Registration for New Rendering Systems

âœ… FIXED CONSOLE ERRORS:
- Added renderingQueueManager, renderValidator, renderRecoveryManager to system registrar
- Updated enhanced-system-registrar.js to import and register Phase 2 systems
- Increased expected core system count from 8 to 11 systems
- Added global exposure for all Phase 2 systems

ðŸŽ¯ SYSTEM REGISTRATION UPDATES:
- system-registrar.js: Added Phase 2 systems to valid system names list
- enhanced-system-registrar.js: Added imports and registration for validation & recovery
- Global exposure: renderingQueueManager, renderValidator, renderRecoveryManager
- Enhanced validation with expected methods for Phase 2 systems

ðŸ“‹ EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS:
- Eliminates 'Unknown system registration attempted' errors
- Proper system validation and method checking
- Global system exposure for component integration
- Supports 99%+ render success rate infrastructure

Note: This fixes the system registration errors. If saved components still don't render, 
this indicates a separate state restoration/loading issue that needs investigation."
