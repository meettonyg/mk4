git commit -m "üîß CRITICAL FIX: Enhanced Component Manager DOM flexibility and diagnostics

PROBLEMS RESOLVED:
‚ùå Enhanced component manager init returned false (DOM element not found)
‚ùå Component manager failing to initialize due to hardcoded element ID
‚ùå No diagnostic tools to identify available DOM elements

FIXES IMPLEMENTED:
‚úÖ Enhanced Component Manager now tries multiple possible container IDs
‚úÖ Fallback to class-based selectors if ID-based search fails
‚úÖ Graceful degradation - component addition still works without DOM container
‚úÖ Added comprehensive DOM diagnostic function
‚úÖ Enhanced test function to check initialization status

ENHANCED COMPONENT MANAGER IMPROVEMENTS:
- Tries multiple possible IDs: media-kit-preview, preview-container, preview, etc.
- Falls back to class selectors: .preview-container, .media-kit-preview, etc.
- Still initializes successfully even if no DOM container found
- Component addition (core functionality) works regardless of DOM availability
- Better logging to identify which container was found

DOM DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS:
- checkDOMElements() function to analyze available preview containers
- Enhanced testArchitectureFix() to check initialization status
- Better debugging information for troubleshooting

EXPECTED RESULTS:
‚úÖ Enhanced component manager should initialize successfully
‚úÖ Component addition functionality should work
‚úÖ Better diagnostic information available
‚úÖ Graceful handling of missing DOM elements

State-only mode: Even if no preview container is found, component addition
will still work since it's a state operation, not a DOM operation."
