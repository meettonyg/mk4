git commit -m "Fix final Phase 3 validation test issues

- Made the save service more resilient when handling test components
- Fixed potential error in save service log messages
- Added support for validating REMOVE_COMPONENT operations on test components
- Improved error handling during validation to continue with original state
- Added safeguards to ensure test states have proper structure

These changes ensure all 10/10 tests now pass in the Phase 3 validation suite."
