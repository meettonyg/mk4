git commit -m "✅ ROOT LEVEL FIX: Proper component manager initialization timing

REVERTED GARBAGE APPROACH:
❌ Removed multiple ID fallback searches
❌ Removed class selector fallbacks  
❌ Removed diagnostic workarounds
❌ Removed 'state-only mode' patches

ROOT ISSUE IDENTIFIED & FIXED:
🎯 Enhanced component manager looks for correct element: media-kit-preview
🎯 Element exists in builder-template.php as: <div class='media-kit' id='media-kit-preview'>
🎯 PROBLEM: Component manager initialized before template fully loaded
🎯 SOLUTION: Defer initialization to modal setup phase when all DOM ready

PROPER TIMING SEQUENCE:
1. main.js loads core systems (no DOM dependency)
2. initialization-manager validates systems (no component manager init)
3. Modal setup phase waits for complete DOM including builder template
4. Enhanced component manager initializes with correct timing
5. Component addition functionality works properly

NO PATCHES, NO FALLBACKS, NO WORKAROUNDS:
- Single correct element ID: media-kit-preview
- Proper timing: initialize when DOM is complete
- Clear error logging if element still missing
- Root cause fixed at initialization sequence level

EXPECTED RESULT:
✅ Enhanced component manager initializes successfully
✅ Component addition works without 'init returned false' errors
✅ Clean, predictable initialization sequence"
