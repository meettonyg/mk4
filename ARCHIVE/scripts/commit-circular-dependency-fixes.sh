CRITICAL FIX: Resolved circular dependencies preventing Phase 3 initialization

Fixed Files:
- js/core/state-history.js: Removed enhancedStateManager import, access via window
- js/core/ui-registry.js: Removed enhancedStateManager import, access via window  
- js/services/save-service.js: Removed enhancedStateManager import, access via window

Changes Made:
- Removed direct imports of enhancedStateManager from dependent modules
- Updated all methods to access enhancedStateManager through window.enhancedStateManager
- Added proper null checks and error handling for missing state manager
- Added retry logic for state subscriptions when state manager not ready yet

RESOLVES: ReferenceError: Cannot access 'enhancedStateManager' before initialization
ADDRESSES: Phase 3 systems failing to load due to circular imports
ENSURES: All Phase 3 systems can now initialize without dependency conflicts

Testing: Run fixed-emergency-phase3-loader.js in browser console"
