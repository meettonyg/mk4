## ⚠️ Why Archived?

These scripts were **one-time use** scripts for:
- Migrating from hybrid PHP/Vue to Pure Vue
- Cleaning up legacy code
- Verifying migration success
- Archiving obsolete files

**They are no longer needed because:**
1. ✅ Migration is complete
2. ✅ Legacy code has been removed
3. ✅ Verification passed
4. ✅ Cleanup is done

---

## 🔄 If You Need to Re-run

These scripts are preserved for reference, but should **NOT** need to be re-run because:
- The migration is complete and stable
- Legacy code is already archived
- The system is running Pure Vue successfully

**If you think you need to re-run these:**
1. Check if the issue can be solved another way
2. Review what the script does carefully
3. Make sure you have backups
4. Consider if a new approach is better
