Phase 6.2: Loading Indicators Implementation Summary
Date: June 18, 2025
Task: Add professional loading indicators to all async operations.
Status: âœ… COMPLETED

Files Modified
1. css/modules/loading.css (New File)
Lines Modified: ~40 lines added.
Change: Created a new, dedicated CSS module for all loading indicator styles.
Impact: Centralizes spinner and saving-state animations for consistent design and easy maintenance.
2. css/guestify-builder.css
Lines Modified: 1 line added.
Change: Added @import url('modules/loading.css'); to include the new styles in the main stylesheet.
Impact: Ensures loading styles are available throughout the application.
3. js/ui/dnd.js
Lines Modified: ~8 lines added/modified.
Change: Wrapped the addComponentToZone call within the drop event listener in a try...finally block.
Impact: Adds the .is-loading class to a drop zone while a component is being fetched and guarantees its removal, even if the operation fails.
4. js/services/template-loader.js
Lines Modified: ~10 lines added/modified.
Change: Wrapped the template fetching logic in loadTemplate within a try...finally block.
Impact: Adds the .is-loading class to the main preview container during a full template load and ensures the indicator is always removed.
5. js/services/save-service.js
Lines Modified: ~6 lines added/modified.
Change: Modified the saveMediaKit function to add/remove the .toolbar__status-dot--saving class on the toolbar's status indicator.
Impact: Provides clear visual feedback directly on the save button and status display during the save operation.
Key Features Implemented
Consistent Spinner: A single, reusable CSS spinner is now used for all loading operations.
User Feedback on Save: The save button and status indicator now clearly show a "saving..." state.
Component Load Indicator: When adding a component, the specific drop zone shows a loading spinner.
Template Load Overlay: When loading a full template, the entire preview area shows a loading state, preventing interaction with stale content.
Robust Error Handling: Using try...finally blocks ensures the UI never gets stuck in a loading state, even if a network request fails.
Testing Results
Normal Speed: All indicators appear and disappear correctly.
Slow 3G Simulation: Indicators are clearly visible for an appropriate duration, improving perceived performance.
Error Conditions: Forcing a fetch to fail correctly removes the loading indicator and logs an error to the console.
Success Criteria: All success criteria from the plan have been met. The indicators are consistent, non-blocking, and handle errors gracefully.
Next Steps
With performance caching and loading indicators now implemented, the next logical step according to the plan is Phase 6.3: Replace Alert Calls with Toast Notifications to further improve the user experience.
