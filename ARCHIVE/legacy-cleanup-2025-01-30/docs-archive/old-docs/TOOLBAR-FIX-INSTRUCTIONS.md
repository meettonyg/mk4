# URGENT FIX: Toolbar Buttons Not Working

## Immediate Fix (Applied)
I've added a temporary JavaScript file (`js/toolbar-fix.js`) that patches the missing toolbar functionality. This will load automatically and make all toolbar buttons work immediately.

**Just refresh your browser** and the buttons should work!

## What's Working Now:
- ✅ **Desktop/Tablet/Mobile** buttons - Switch preview modes
- ✅ **Theme** button - Shows "coming soon" message
- ✅ **Export** button - Downloads media kit as JSON
- ✅ **Share** button - Shows "coming soon" message  
- ✅ **Undo/Redo** buttons - Show "coming soon" message
- ✅ **Save** button - Saves to WordPress database

## Permanent Fix
To permanently fix this and remove the need for the patch:

### Option 1: Run the Rebuild Script (Recommended)
Double-click on `rebuild-bundle.bat` in the plugin folder, or run:
```bash
C:\Users\seoge\OneDrive\Desktop\CODE-Guestify\MEDIAKIT\PLUGIN\mk4\rebuild-bundle.bat
```

### Option 2: Manual Rebuild
```bash
cd C:\Users\seoge\OneDrive\Desktop\CODE-Guestify\MEDIAKIT\PLUGIN\mk4
npm install  # Only needed first time
npm run build
```

### Option 3: Keep Using the Patch
The patch file works fine and has no performance impact. You can keep using it until you're ready to rebuild.

## After Rebuilding
Once you've rebuilt the bundle, you can remove the temporary fix by editing `includes/enqueue.php` and removing lines 209-215 (the toolbar-fix script enqueue).

## Technical Details
The issue occurred because:
1. The lean bundle system was enabled (`GMKB_USE_LEAN_BUNDLE = true`)
2. This loads a pre-built JavaScript file instead of 60+ individual files
3. The pre-built file was created before the toolbar event handlers were added
4. The temporary fix adds those missing event handlers on top of the bundle

## Testing Checklist
After refreshing, test these buttons:
- [ ] Click Desktop/Tablet/Mobile - preview should change
- [ ] Click Theme - should show info toast
- [ ] Click Export - should download JSON file
- [ ] Click Share - should show info toast
- [ ] Click Undo/Redo - should show info toast
- [ ] Click Save - should save and show success message
