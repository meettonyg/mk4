 * Design Panel - LEGACY VERSION (Phase 4)
 * 
 * This file has been archived as part of Phase 5: Remove Legacy Systems
 * 
 * ARCHIVED DATE: 2025-01-29
 * REASON: PHP design panel rendering deprecated in favor of Vue components
 * 
 * ORIGINAL SIZE: ~15KB
 * NEW SIZE: ~1KB stub
 * 
 * WHAT THIS FILE DID:
 * - Rendered design panels server-side using PHP templates
 * - Returned HTML strings for each component's design panel
 * - Caused duplicate rendering issues with Vue
 * 
 * REPLACEMENT:
 * - All design panels now handled by Vue components client-side
 * - DesignPanel.php simplified to 1KB stub for backward compatibility
 * - No PHP rendering of panels
 * 
 * ROLLBACK:
 * If you need to restore PHP panel rendering, copy this file back to:
 * system/DesignPanel.php
