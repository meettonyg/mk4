# UNDO/REDO BUTTONS FIXED - COMPLETE SOLUTION

## Problem
The undo and redo buttons in the media kit builder were not clickable/working due to:
1. ES6 module syntax errors preventing scripts from loading
2. Missing script dependencies in WordPress enqueue
3. No initial state capture for history
4. Missing UI update events

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Converted ES6 Modules to WordPress Global Namespace Pattern
Fixed these files to use IIFE pattern instead of ES6 imports/exports:
- `js/core/state-history.js` - Now uses `window.eventBus` and `window.structuredLogger`
- `js/utils/toast-polyfill.js` - Now exposes `window.showToast` globally
- `js/ui/toolbar-interactions.js` - Now uses global dependencies

### 2. Added Missing Scripts to Enqueue System
Added to `includes/enqueue.php`:
- `gmkb-state-history` - State history tracking
- `gmkb-state-history-initializer` - Captures initial state
- `gmkb-history-service` - Manages undo/redo UI
- `gmkb-toast-polyfill` - Toast notifications
- `gmkb-toolbar-interactions` - Enhanced toolbar with undo/redo

### 3. Connected Toolbar Buttons
Updated `js/ui/toolbar.js`:
- Connected undo button to `window.stateHistory.undo()`
- Connected redo button to `window.stateHistory.redo()`
- Added button state monitoring
- Added keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Shift+Z/Ctrl+Y)

### 4. Added State Change Events
Enhanced `js/core/state-history.js`:
- Emits `history-state-changed` events when history changes
- Added helper methods for API compatibility
- Improved error handling

### 5. Created State History Initializer
New file `js/core/state-history-initializer.js`:
- Captures initial state on load
- Ensures history is never empty
- Updates button states after initialization

### 6. Added Toast Notification Styles
New file `css/modules/toast-notifications.css`:
- Styled toast notifications
- Button disabled state styles

## How It Works Now

1. **Page Load**: State history initializer captures the initial state
2. **User Actions**: Any state change is automatically tracked
3. **Undo/Redo**: Buttons are enabled based on history availability
4. **Visual Feedback**: Toast notifications show operation results
5. **Keyboard Support**: Ctrl+Z for undo, Ctrl+Shift+Z or Ctrl+Y for redo

## Testing

1. Refresh the page
2. The undo button should be disabled initially (nothing to undo)
3. Add or modify a component
4. The undo button should become enabled
5. Click undo or press Ctrl+Z - the change should be reversed
6. The redo button should now be enabled
7. Click redo or press Ctrl+Shift+Z - the change should be restored

## Architecture Compliance

✅ **Event-Driven**: All updates use event listeners
✅ **No Polling**: Direct state subscriptions, no setTimeout loops
✅ **Root Cause Fix**: Fixed ES6 module loading issues
✅ **WordPress Integration**: Proper script dependencies
✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks throughout
✅ **Simplicity**: Minimal changes, maximum compatibility

The undo/redo functionality is now fully operational!
