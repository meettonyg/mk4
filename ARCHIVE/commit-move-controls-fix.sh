# Create commit with detailed message
git commit -m "fix: Component move controls now update UI immediately

Root Cause: Multiple systems (UI Registry and Enhanced Component Renderer) were
both listening to state changes and attempting to render independently, causing
race conditions and duplicate render blocks.

Solution:
- Disabled state subscription in UI Registry (commented out lines 63-78)
- UI Registry now only listens for render completion events
- Enhanced Component Renderer is the single source of truth for rendering
- Added smart render strategies: reorder-only moves don't re-render components
- Added proper timing delays for DOM operations after adds/updates

Changes:
- js/core/ui-registry.js: Removed duplicate state subscription
- js/core/enhanced-component-renderer.js: Enhanced processChanges methods
- Added comprehensive test suite for move operations
- Added verification script to check fix implementation

Testing:
- Run: window.runMoveTests() to test all move operations
- Run: node verify-move-fix.js to verify the fix is working
- Components should move visually immediately when buttons are clicked

This fix ensures immediate visual feedback matching state changes, eliminating
the frustrating experience where moves appeared to do nothing."
