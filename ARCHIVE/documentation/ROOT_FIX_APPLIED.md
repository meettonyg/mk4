# Components Persistence Issue - ROOT FIX APPLIED

## Problem Summary
Components were being lost during the save operation. The frontend was sending components correctly, but the PHP backend was not preserving them properly when saving to the database.

## Root Cause Found
The `convert_to_array_preserve_objects` function was converting ALL objects to arrays, including the components object. When components had data, it was being converted to a regular PHP array. However, WordPress's serialization and the way we were handling empty vs non-empty arrays was causing the components to be lost.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced `convert_to_array_preserve_objects` Function
- Added path tracking to identify when we're processing the 'components' object
- Special handling for components to preserve them as associative arrays
- Empty components objects remain as StdClass to ensure {} in JSON

### 2. Improved Data Validation
- No longer forcibly converting components to arrays when they already exist
- Preserve components in their received format (object or array)
- Only convert empty arrays to StdClass for proper JSON encoding

### 3. Enhanced Debug Logging
- Log components count before and after conversion
- Track component IDs being processed
- Verify what's actually saved to database

## Key Changes in `gmkb-ajax-handlers.php`

1. **Line ~395-410**: Added detailed debugging of raw state before conversion
2. **Line ~487-530**: Updated `convert_to_array_preserve_objects` to handle components specially
3. **Line ~441-466**: Fixed data validation to not destroy existing components

## Testing Steps
1. Clear browser cache and reload the Media Kit Builder
2. Add a component (e.g., biography)
3. Check console - should see "Saving state with components: 1"
4. Save should report correct component count
5. Reload the page
6. Should NOT see "Reconstructed missing component" message
7. Media Kit Data Viewer should show correct component count

## Success Indicators
- Save response shows `components_count: 1` (not 0)
- No "Found X components in sections but not in components object" on reload
- No "Reconstructed missing component" messages
- Components persist through save/reload cycles

## Technical Details
The fix ensures that JavaScript objects remain properly structured through the PHP processing pipeline:
- JS sends: `{components: {id1: {...}}}`
- PHP receives and preserves structure
- WordPress saves with proper serialization
- Load returns same structure to JS

This is a true root-level fix addressing the data type handling between JavaScript and PHP.
