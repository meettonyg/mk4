# Vue Controls Edit Button Fix - Complete

## Problem Identified
The edit button was throwing `ReferenceError: props is not defined` when clicked, preventing the Biography component's design panel from opening.

## Root Cause
The Vue control components (ComponentControls.vue and SectionControls.vue) were using inline `$emit()` calls in templates that referenced `props` and `component` directly, but these weren't properly accessible in the template scope.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed ComponentControls.vue
- Added `{ emit }` to the setup function parameters
- Created `handleAction` method that properly emits events
- Replaced inline `@click="$emit(...)"` with `@click="handleAction(...)"`

### 2. Fixed SectionControls.vue
- Same pattern as ComponentControls
- Added `{ emit }` to setup
- Created `handleAction` method
- Updated all button clicks to use method

### 3. Updated Biography.vue
- Simplified event listening to use document-level `gmkb:open-vue-panel` event
- Removed complex element-specific event listeners
- Cleaned up unused handler functions

## Testing the Fix

1. **Add a Biography component** to your media kit
2. **Hover over it** - controls should appear on the right
3. **Click the Edit button** - Biography's design panel should slide in from the right
4. **Test other buttons**:
   - Move up/down should reorder the component
   - Duplicate should create a copy
   - Delete should remove it (with confirmation)

## Console Commands for Testing
```javascript
// Add a biography component
window.GMKB.addComponent('biography')

// Check if controls are mounted
window.gmkbControlsInstance

// Debug state
window.debugGMKB.showComponents()
```

## What Works Now

✅ **Edit button** opens Biography design panel
✅ **Move buttons** reorder components
✅ **Duplicate** creates component copies
✅ **Delete** removes components
✅ **Section controls** work properly
✅ **No more console errors** when clicking controls

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Clean event flow**: Controls → ControlsOverlay → ComponentEditPanel → Biography
2. **No prop drilling**: Each component handles its own scope
3. **Proper Vue patterns**: Using emit properly with setup composition API
4. **Maintainable**: Clear method names and event handling

## Next Steps if Needed

If other Vue components need edit panels:
1. Add them to the ComponentEditPanel.js type check
2. Have them listen for `gmkb:open-vue-panel` event
3. Implement their own design panel component

The system is now fully functional with proper event handling and no errors!
