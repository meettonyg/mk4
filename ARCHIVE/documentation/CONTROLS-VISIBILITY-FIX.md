# Controls Visibility Fix - Summary

## Issue Identified
The Vue controls CSS file (`vue-controls.css`) was not being loaded after page refresh, causing the controls to be invisible even though the hover detection was working correctly.

## Root Cause
The `vue-controls.css` file existed but was not being enqueued in the WordPress `enqueue.php` file. This meant the critical styles for control visibility were missing.

## Fix Applied
Added the CSS enqueue in two places in `/includes/enqueue.php`:

1. **For Lean Bundle Mode** (around line 342):
```php
// Vue controls styles - CRITICAL for control visibility
wp_enqueue_style(
    'gmkb-vue-controls',
    $plugin_url . 'css/vue-controls.css',
    array('gmkb-lean-styles'),
    $version
);
```

2. **For Standard Mode** (around line 2216):
```php
// Vue controls styles - CRITICAL for control visibility
wp_enqueue_style(
    'gmkb-vue-controls',
    $plugin_url . 'css/vue-controls.css',
    array('gmkb-builder-styles'),
    $version
);
```

## Testing Instructions

1. **Clear browser cache**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (or `Cmd+Shift+R` on Mac)
2. **Refresh the page** containing the Media Kit Builder
3. **Hover over components** - you should now see the control buttons appear
4. **Test the controls**:
   - Move up/down arrows
   - Edit button
   - Duplicate button
   - Delete button

## Verification

Run this in the browser console to verify the fix:
```javascript
// Check if CSS is loaded
const loaded = !!Array.from(document.styleSheets).find(s => s.href?.includes('vue-controls.css'));
console.log('Vue controls CSS loaded:', loaded);
```

## What the CSS Provides

The `vue-controls.css` file contains:
- Proper z-index hierarchy for controls overlay
- Styling for control buttons (hover effects, colors, transitions)
- Animation for control appearance
- Proper positioning to ensure controls appear above components
- Hide legacy control systems that might conflict

## Expected Result

After the fix, when you hover over components:
1. A subtle outline appears around the component
2. Control buttons appear with smooth animation
3. Each button has distinct hover colors:
   - Move buttons: Purple
   - Edit button: Blue
   - Duplicate button: Green
   - Delete button: Red

The controls should now work consistently across page refreshes.
