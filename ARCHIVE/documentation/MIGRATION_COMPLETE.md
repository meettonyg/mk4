- **Pending**: 5 (31.25%)
- **All have manifests**: ✅
- **Build working**: ✅

## 🎯 Final Steps

1. Move the remaining 5 Vue renderers to their component directories
2. Update ComponentRenderer.vue to import all from component directories
3. Delete the `src/vue/components/renderers/` directory
4. Run final build test

## Build Test

The build is currently working with the hybrid approach:
```bash
npm run build
```

Output shows successful build:
```
✓ 146 modules transformed.
dist/gmkb.iife.js  421.06 kB
✓ built in 3.52s
```

## Architecture Achievement

✅ **Self-contained component architecture** is nearly complete!
- Each component has its own directory
- All components have manifest files (component.json)
- Vue renderers are being progressively moved
- Build process supports both locations during migration
- No breaking changes during migration
