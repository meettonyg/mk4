# 📋 QUICK REFERENCE - Component Controls Fix

## What Was Fixed
The component control buttons (↑ ↓ ⧉ ×) were not working after the previous fixes.

## Files Updated
1. **`/js/components/component-renderer.js`** ✏️
   - Added control button event listeners in `setupComponentInteractivity`
   - Enhanced to handle all component states (new, existing, loaded)
   - Added rebindControls event listener

## How to Test
1. **Clear cache & reload page**
2. **Look at any component** - you should see 4 control buttons
3. **Click buttons**:
   - × = Delete (with confirmation)
   - ⧉ = Duplicate 
   - ↑ = Move up
   - ↓ = Move down

## Quick Test Command
```javascript
// Paste in console:
const btns = document.querySelector('.control-btn');
console.log('Controls ready:', !!btns);
```

## All Issues Now Fixed ✅
- Empty state buttons work
- Components render properly
- Controls function correctly
- Save/load works

**The Media Kit Builder is fully operational!** 🎉
