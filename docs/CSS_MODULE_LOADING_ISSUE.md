# CSS Module Loading Issue - Critical Problem

## The Problem
All CSS `@import` statements in `guestify-builder.css` are failing with 404 errors. This means NONE of the modular CSS files are loading:
- base.css
- preview.css  
- empty-state-center.css
- All other module files

This is why the empty state centering isn't working - the CSS fixes we applied to the module files aren't being loaded by the browser.

## Root Cause
The WordPress plugin is not serving the CSS module files correctly, likely due to:
1. Incorrect file paths in the build/deployment
2. Missing URL rewriting for CSS modules
3. CSS bundling/compilation issues

## Immediate Solution
Since we cannot fix the server-side issue, we've added all critical styles directly to the main `guestify-builder.css` file.

## Emergency Fix
If the styles still don't work, run this in the browser console:
```javascript
// Copy the contents of emergency-css-fix.js and paste in console
```

## Long-term Solution Needed
1. Fix the CSS module loading on the server side
2. OR bundle all CSS into a single file during build
3. OR use a CSS preprocessor to compile all modules into one file

## Files Affected
- `/css/guestify-builder.css` - Now contains inline critical styles
- All files in `/css/modules/` - Currently not loading (404 errors)
