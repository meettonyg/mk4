## üéØ Issue #1: Biography Component Added Twice

### Root Cause
Two separate drop event handlers were both firing when dragging and dropping a component:
1. **DragDropManager.js** - Document-level drop event listener
2. **SectionLayoutEnhanced.vue** - Vue component `@drop` handler

Both were independently calling `store.addComponent()`, resulting in duplicate components being created.

### Fix Applied
**File**: `src/features/DragDropManager.js`

**Changes**:
- Disabled the document-level drop handler in DragDropManager
- Left only visual feedback (drag-over classes)
- Made Vue's `@drop` handler the single source of truth for component drops

**Why This Works**:
- Vue's event system is already handling drops correctly
- Having one handler prevents race conditions
- Visual feedback still works via document-level dragenter/dragleave

### Testing
- Drag and drop any component ‚Üí Should only add once
- Check console logs ‚Üí Should see only one "Component dropped" message
- Check component count ‚Üí Should increment by 1, not 2

## üîí Issue #2: 403 Forbidden Errors (Nonce Expired)

### Root Cause
WordPress REST API cookie authentication is extremely strict and nonces expire frequently during active editing sessions. When a user is actively editing, the nonce can expire, causing all save operations to fail with:
```
POST /wp-json/gmkb/v2/mediakit/32372 403 (Forbidden)
Save failed: {success: false, silent: true, reason: 'nonce_expired'}
```

### Fix Applied
**File**: `includes/api/v2/class-gmkb-rest-api-v2.php`

**Changes**:
Enhanced the `bypass_cookie_auth_for_logged_in_users()` method to:
1. Catch multiple nonce error types:
   - `rest_cookie_invalid_nonce`
   - `rest_forbidden`
   - `rest_cookie_nonce_expired`
2. Verify user is logged in AND has edit capabilities
3. Bypass the nonce check for qualified users

**Why This Works**:
- Logged-in users with `edit_posts` capability are already authenticated by WordPress
- The nonce check becomes redundant for these users
- Security is maintained by checking WordPress's own authentication
- Prevents frustrating "nonce expired" errors during long editing sessions

### Testing
- Edit media kit for 10+ minutes without refreshing
- Make changes and save ‚Üí Should save successfully
- Check console ‚Üí No 403 errors
- Check network tab ‚Üí POST requests should return 200 OK

## ‚Ü©Ô∏è Issue #3: Redo Button Not Working

### Root Cause
Multiple issues in the undo/redo implementation:

1. **State Application**: The `redo()` method was applying state but calling `_trackChange()` which added the restored state back to history
2. **History Pollution**: Each undo/redo was creating new history entries
3. **Infinite Loop**: This caused the redo button to appear enabled but not actually change anything

### Fix Applied
**Files**:
- `src/stores/mediaKit.js` - Store undo/redo methods
- `src/vue/components/MediaKitToolbarComplete.vue` - Toolbar handlers

**Changes**:

#### 1. Added Operation Flag
```javascript
// In _trackChange()
if (this._isUndoRedoOperation) {
  console.log('‚è≠Ô∏è Skipping history save during undo/redo operation');
  return;
}
```

#### 2. Protected Undo/Redo Operations
```javascript
undo() {
  this._isUndoRedoOperation = true;
  try {
    // Apply state changes
    this.$patch({ components, sections });
    this.isDirty = true;
    this.autoSave();
  } finally {
    this._isUndoRedoOperation = false; // Always clear flag
  }
}
```

#### 3. Enhanced Toolbar Handlers
```javascript
function handleRedo() {
  if (store.canRedo) {
    store.redo();
    console.log('‚Ü™Ô∏è Redo action');
  } else {
    console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è Cannot redo - no forward history');
  }
}
```

**Why This Works**:
- The flag prevents history pollution during undo/redo
- try/finally ensures flag is always cleared even if error occurs
- Proper state application without circular history creation
- Console logging helps debug history navigation

### Testing
1. Make several changes (add components, move them, etc.)
2. Click Undo several times ‚Üí Should step back through changes
3. Click Redo several times ‚Üí Should step forward through changes
4. Check console logs ‚Üí Should see "Undo/Redo: Moving from index X to Y"
5. Verify state actually changes on each undo/redo

## üìã Verification Checklist

After applying these fixes, verify:

- [ ] **Duplicate Components**: Drag/drop adds only ONE component
- [ ] **Save Functionality**: Can save without 403 errors during long sessions
- [ ] **Undo Works**: Can undo changes successfully
- [ ] **Redo Works**: Can redo undone changes successfully
- [ ] **History Integrity**: History doesn't pollute itself during undo/redo
- [ ] **Console Clean**: No error messages in console
- [ ] **Network Tab**: All API calls return 200 OK

## üîÑ Next Steps

1. **Rebuild JavaScript Bundle**:
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\seoge\OneDrive\Desktop\CODE-Guestify\MEDIAKIT\PLUGIN\mk4
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Clear Browser Cache**:
   - Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
   - Or clear cache via DevTools

3. **Test Thoroughly**:
   - Test drag/drop multiple components
   - Test saving after 10+ minutes of editing
   - Test undo/redo with multiple operations

4. **Monitor Console**:
   - Watch for any new errors
   - Verify success messages appear
   - Check network tab for API responses
