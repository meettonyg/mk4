## Architecture Analysis

### ✅ Self-Contained Component Structure (EXCELLENT!)

The project follows the recommended self-contained architecture:

```
/components/{type}/
  ├── {Type}Renderer.vue   ← Vue component for display
  ├── {Type}Editor.vue      ← Vue component for editing
  ├── component.json        ← Component metadata
  └── template.php          ← PHP fallback (to be deprecated)
```

**Renderers Present:** 17/17 (100.0%)
**Editors Present:** 17/17 (100.0%)
