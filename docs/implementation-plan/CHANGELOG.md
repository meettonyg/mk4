## Performance Tracking

| Date | Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|------|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| TBD | Component Add (first) | ~1000ms | ~1000ms | 0% |
| TBD | Component Add (cached) | ~1000ms | <100ms | 90%+ |
| TBD | State Save | ~45ms | ~45ms | 0% |
| TBD | Full Re-render | ~180ms | ~180ms | 0% |

## Risk Log

| Date | Risk Identified | Mitigation | Status |
|------|----------------|------------|---------|
| TBD | Example risk | Example mitigation | Open/Closed |

## Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|------|----------|-----------|---------|
| [Today] | Use Vitest over Jest | Faster, less config, Jest-compatible | Testing implementation |
| [Today] | Cache by plugin version | Auto-invalidate on updates | Cache strategy |
| [Today] | Schema validation warnings only | Don't break existing components | Backward compatibility |

## Dependencies Tracking

### Added
- [ ] vitest
- [ ] @testing-library/dom
- [ ] @testing-library/jest-dom
- [ ] jsdom

### Removed (Phase 8)
- [ ] Legacy component-manager.js
- [ ] Legacy component-renderer.js  
- [ ] Conditional loader system
- [ ] Unused feature flags

## Next Steps Queue

1. Start with Prompt 6.1 (Template Caching)
2. Test thoroughly before moving to 6.2
3. Complete all Phase 6 before starting Phase 7
4. Ensure 2-week stability before Phase 8 cleanup
