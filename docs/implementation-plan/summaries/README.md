# Phase Summaries

This directory will contain summaries created after completing each implementation phase.

## Expected Summaries

1. **phase-6-summary.md** - After completing Performance Optimization (Phase 6)
2. **phase-7-summary.md** - After completing Testing & Validation (Phase 7)
3. **phase-8-final-summary.md** - After completing Documentation & Cleanup (Phase 8)
4. **FINAL-VALIDATION-REPORT.md** - Final system validation and sign-off

## Summary Template

Each summary should include:

1. **Files Modified**
   - List of all files changed
   - Line counts or percentages changed
   - Nature of changes (added/modified/deleted)

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - Before and after measurements
   - Improvement percentages
   - Any regressions found

3. **Issues & Solutions**
   - Problems encountered
   - How they were resolved
   - Time impact

4. **Deviations from Plan**
   - What changed from original plan
   - Why changes were necessary
   - Impact on timeline

5. **Testing Results**
   - What was tested
   - Test results
   - Any failures and fixes

6. **Next Phase Recommendations**
   - What to watch for
   - Suggested improvements
   - Risk areas

7. **Time Tracking**
   - Estimated vs actual time
   - Reasons for variance
   - Efficiency insights

## Creating Summaries

Use the summary prompts provided in the implementation series:
- Phase 6 Summary: After prompts 6.1, 6.2, 6.3
- Phase 7 Summary: After prompts 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4
- Phase 8 Summary: After prompts 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4

Each summary prompt includes specific requirements for that phase.
