# Add Component and Load Template Fix - Summary

**Date**: January 2025  
**Issue**: Add Component and Load Template buttons not working after layout array fix

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by multiple initialization problems:

1. **Initialization Order**: Enhanced initialization was not being called properly from main.js
2. **Global Variables**: window.componentManager was not being set when using enhanced mode
3. **Component Type Mapping**: Component library was using incorrect mapping for component types
4. **Double Initialization**: Both main.js and media-kit-builder-init.js were trying to initialize

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Main.js Initialization
- Changed from `return` to actually calling `mediaKitBuilderInit.initialize()`
- Ensures enhanced initialization runs when feature flag is enabled

### 2. Removed Auto-initialization from media-kit-builder-init.js
- Prevents timing issues and double initialization
- main.js now controls when initialization happens

### 3. Fixed Component Library
- Removed unnecessary componentTypeMap
- Uses component directory name directly from data-component attribute

### 4. Added Direct Event Handler for Template Button
- Load Template button now has click handler added directly
- Ensures it works even if template library loads later

## Files Modified

1. `js/main.js` - Fixed to properly call enhanced initialization
2. `js/core/media-kit-builder-init.js` - Removed auto-initialization, added template button handler
3. `js/modals/component-library.js` - Fixed component type mapping

## Quick Console Fix

If buttons still don't work, run this in console:
```javascript
// Ensure managers are available
window.componentManager = window.enhancedComponentManager;
window.stateManager = window.enhancedStateManager;

// Initialize if needed
if (!window.enhancedComponentManager.initialized) {
    window.enhancedComponentManager.init();
}
```

## Testing

1. Reload the page
2. Check console for initialization messages
3. Click "Add Component" button - modal should open
4. Select a component - it should be added
5. Click "Load Template" - template library should open
6. Select a template - components should load

## Verification Script

Run in console:
```javascript
console.log('Managers:', {
    component: !!window.componentManager,
    state: !!window.stateManager,
    initialized: window.enhancedComponentManager?.initialized
});
```

## Additional Notes

- The enhanced system is now the default when feature flags are enabled
- Both legacy and enhanced paths work correctly
- Global window objects are properly set for both modes
- Template loader uses window references to get current managers
