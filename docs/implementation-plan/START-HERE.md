# START HERE - First Implementation Prompt

Copy and use this prompt to begin the Media Kit Builder optimization:

---

```
TASK: Implement client-side template caching for 90%+ performance improvement

REFERENCE: C:\Users\seoge\OneDrive\Desktop\CODE-Guestify\MEDIAKIT\PLUGIN\mk4\docs\implementation-plan\FINAL-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md (Section 6.1)

REQUIREMENTS:
1. FIX THE CODE DIRECTLY AT THE ROOT LEVEL, NO PATCHES OR QUICK FIXES
2. INVESTIGATE THE PHP CODE BEFORE THE JS TO IDENTIFY THE ROOT ISSUE
3. First outline the plan get approval and then start coding
4. EDIT THE CODE DIRECTLY after approval
5. IMPLEMENT the file edits directly, files are located here: C:\Users\seoge\OneDrive\Desktop\CODE-Guestify\MEDIAKIT\PLUGIN\mk4\

INVESTIGATION NEEDED:
- Check includes/enqueue.php for how pluginVersion is passed to JS
- Verify guestify-media-kit-builder.php for version constant
- Review includes/api/class-component-api.php for template generation

EXPECTED PLAN OUTLINE:
1. PHP investigation results
2. Cache implementation strategy
3. Hydration method design
4. Cache invalidation approach
5. Performance measurement plan

TARGET FILES:
- js/components/dynamic-component-loader.js (main implementation)
- includes/enqueue.php (version passing)

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- 90%+ reduction in load time after first component
- Cache hit rate displayed in console
- Version-based cache invalidation working
```

## What This Will Do

This first prompt will implement template caching, which is the **highest impact** performance improvement available. After the first load of each component type, subsequent loads will be nearly instant.

## Expected Timeline

- Investigation: 30 minutes
- Plan outline: 15 minutes  
- Implementation: 1-2 hours
- Testing: 30 minutes

## Next Steps

After this prompt is complete:
1. Test by adding multiple components of the same type
2. Verify cache hit messages in console
3. Check performance improvement
4. Move to Prompt 6.2 (Loading Indicators)

## Quick Test

After implementation, test with:
```javascript
// Add 5 hero components rapidly
for(let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    window.componentManager.addComponent('hero');
}
// First should be ~1000ms, rest should be <100ms
```
