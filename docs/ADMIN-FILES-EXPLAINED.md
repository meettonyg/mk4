## If You Want to Remove Something...

**DON'T remove these files** - they're all useful!

But if you REALLY want to simplify, the ONLY optional one is:
- **settings.php** - You can remove if you never need to toggle architecture modes

**Everything else is genuinely useful for your workflow.**

---

## File Size Impact

```
admin-init.php:       ~1KB  (orchestration)
settings.php:         ~7KB  (settings page)
media-kit-viewer.php: ~15KB (YOUR DATA VIEWER)
diagnostic-tools.php: ~12KB (REPAIR TOOL)
data-cleanup.php:     ~8KB  (data quality)
-----------------------------------
TOTAL:               ~43KB  (smaller than a single image!)
```

**Recommendation**: Keep all 5. They're tiny and genuinely useful!

## Bottom Line

‚úÖ **Use diagnostic-tools.php to fix your current error**  
‚úÖ **Use media-kit-viewer.php to monitor component data**  
‚úÖ **Let data-cleanup.php run once to prevent future issues**

**These tools will save you hours of debugging time!**
