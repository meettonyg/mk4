   - WHEN: "in their first 3 years"

## Best Practices

### For Professional Results

1. **Be Specific** - Vague inputs = generic outputs
2. **Include Context** - Tell the AI about your audience and purpose
3. **Review and Edit** - AI provides a starting point, not final copy
4. **Stay Consistent** - Use similar tone across all content
5. **Save Variations** - Generate multiple versions to compare

### Content You Should Always Edit

- Statistics and numbers (verify accuracy)
- Claims and credentials (ensure truthfulness)
- Company names and dates (AI may hallucinate)
- Industry-specific terminology (verify correctness)

### When to Regenerate

- Content sounds too generic
- Tone doesn't match your brand
- Key points are missing
- Length isn't quite right

### Can I use the generated content commercially?

Yes! All content generated is yours to use for any purpose, including commercial media kits, marketing materials, and press releases.

### Will my content be unique?

Each generation is unique based on your inputs. However, since AI draws from patterns, similar inputs may produce similar outputs. Always personalize the content.

### Can I edit the generated content?
