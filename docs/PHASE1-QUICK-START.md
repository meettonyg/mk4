# üöÄ QUICK START: Phase 1 Enqueue Consolidation

**‚è±Ô∏è Total Time**: 30 minutes  
**üéØ Goal**: Replace bloated enqueue.php with clean Vue-only version

---

## ‚ö° Fast Track (If Confident)

```bash
# 1. Backup
cd C:\Users\seoge\OneDrive\Desktop\CODE-Guestify\MEDIAKIT\PLUGIN\mk4
cp -r includes includes-backup-BEFORE-PHASE1

# 2. Switch files
cd includes
mv enqueue.php enqueue-OLD.php
mv enqueue-vue-only.php enqueue.php

# 3. Test
# Open Media Kit Builder in browser
# Check console for errors
# Test add/edit/save components

# 4. If problems: Rollback
mv enqueue.php enqueue-FAILED.php
mv enqueue-OLD.php enqueue.php
```

## üìã Testing Checklist

After switching files:

- [ ] Clear browser cache completely
- [ ] Load Media Kit Builder page
- [ ] Open browser console (F12)
- [ ] Check: `console.log(window.gmkbData)` shows object
- [ ] Check: Network tab shows ~5-10 scripts (not 60+)
- [ ] Test: Add a component from library
- [ ] Test: Edit the component in design panel
- [ ] Test: Save media kit
- [ ] Test: Refresh page - component still there

**All checks pass?** ‚úÖ SUCCESS! Move to Phase 2
