# Tabs and Modals Fix Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed main.js initialization
- Added `setupCoreUI()` call in enhanced initialization path to ensure UI components are always initialized
- This prevents UI components from being skipped when using enhanced initialization

### 2. Enhanced tabs.js functionality
- Changed from individual event listeners to event delegation on the container
- Added support for multiple content ID formats (tab-name-tab, tab-name-panel, data-tab attribute)
- Added debugging output to help identify missing content panels
- Made tab switching more robust with fallback content finding

### 3. Improved component-library.js
- Added direct event listeners for both add component buttons (main and empty state)
- Kept event delegation as fallback for dynamically created buttons
- Added proper preventDefault() handling to avoid conflicts
- Added console logging for debugging

### 4. Created comprehensive debug script
- Located at: js/tests/debug-tabs-modals.js
- Provides testing functions for tabs and modals
- Includes manual fix functions if initialization fails
- Checks initialization status and feature flags

## How to Test

1. **Reload the page** to ensure all changes are loaded

2. **Run this in the console to load debug tools:**
```javascript
// Load the debug script
import('./js/tests/debug-tabs-modals.js').then(() => {
    console.log('Debug tools loaded! Use mkDebugUI commands.');
});
```

3. **Test tabs:**
```javascript
// This will automatically click through all tabs
mkDebugUI.testTabs();
```

4. **Test component library modal:**
```javascript
// Try to open the component library
mkDebugUI.openComponentLibrary();
```

5. **If things aren't working, apply fixes:**
```javascript
// This will reattach all event handlers
mkDebugUI.fixAll();
```

## Quick Test Commands

```javascript
// Test everything at once
(async () => {
    // Load debug tools
    await import('./js/tests/debug-tabs-modals.js');
    
    // Wait a moment
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500));
    
    // Apply fixes
    mkDebugUI.fixAll();
    
    // Test tabs
    document.querySelector('[data-tab="design"]').click();
    console.log('✅ Clicked Design tab');
    
    // Test modal
    setTimeout(() => {
        mkDebugUI.openComponentLibrary();
        console.log('✅ Opened component library');
    }, 500);
})();
```

## Expected Results

1. **Tabs should switch** when clicked, showing different content panels
2. **Component library modal** should open when clicking "Add Component" button
3. **Console should show** debug information about what's happening

## If Issues Persist

1. Check the console for any JavaScript errors
2. Run `mkDebugUI.checkInit()` to see initialization status
3. Make sure the page has fully loaded before testing
4. Try the manual fixes with `mkDebugUI.fixAll()`

## Root Cause

The issue was that the enhanced initialization system wasn't calling `setupCoreUI()`, which meant UI components weren't being initialized when using the enhanced path. The tabs also needed more robust event handling to work with the dynamic nature of the application.
