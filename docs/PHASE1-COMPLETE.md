## 📦 Deliverables Created

### 1. ✅ Automated Audit Script
**File:** `scripts/phase1-audit.js`

**What it does:**
- Scans all 17 components in `/components` directory
- Checks for Vue equivalents in multiple locations
- Analyzes template complexity (Low/Medium/High)
- Identifies data dependencies (Pods, Post Meta, AJAX)
- Calculates effort estimates for missing components
- Generates comprehensive reports (Markdown + JSON)
- Applies Go/No-Go decision logic automatically

**How to run:**
```bash
# Option 1: Direct execution
cd C:\Users\seoge\OneDrive\Desktop\CODE-Guestify\MEDIAKIT\PLUGIN\mk4
node scripts/phase1-audit.js

# Option 2: Using batch file
scripts\run-phase1-audit.bat
```

| Estimate effort | ✅ Ready | Automated in script |

---

## 📊 Success Criteria - Verification Pending

To verify Phase 1 success, you need to:

1. **Run the audit script:**
   ```bash
   node scripts/phase1-audit.js
   ```

2. **Check the generated reports:**
   - `docs/COMPONENT-INVENTORY.md` - Human-readable report
   - `docs/component-inventory.json` - Machine-readable data

3. **Verify these metrics:**
   - [ ] All components documented
   - [ ] Vue coverage % calculated
   - [ ] Effort estimate provided
   - [ ] Priority matrix generated

---

## 🚦 Go/No-Go Decision Framework

**After running the audit, apply these criteria:**

### ✅ PROCEED TO PHASE 2 IF:
- Vue coverage ≥ 60% **OR**
- Missing components ≤ 5 days effort **OR**
- All P0 components have Vue equivalents

### ⚠️ CONSIDER OPTION B (Hybrid) IF:
- Vue coverage < 40% **AND**
- Missing components > 10 days effort

### ❌ STOP AND REASSESS IF:
- Critical components missing
- Data dependencies too complex
- Total effort > 6 weeks

**The audit script will automatically evaluate these criteria and recommend a decision.**

---

## 🎬 Next Actions Required

### Immediate (Do Now):

1. **Execute the Audit:**
   ```bash
