# SIMPLE DEBUG INSTRUCTIONS

Since you're getting 404 errors when trying to load the debug scripts, just do this:

## Step 1: Copy the Debug Code

Open this file on your computer:
```
C:\Users\seoge\OneDrive\Desktop\CODE-Guestify\MEDIAKIT\PLUGIN\mk4\debug-inline-test.js
```

Copy ALL the content (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)

## Step 2: Paste into Browser Console

1. Go to your builder page
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Paste the code (Ctrl+V)
4. Press Enter

## Step 3: Click Delete Button

Click the Ã— button on any component

## Step 4: Copy Output

Copy everything from the console and send it to me

---

That's it! The debug code will show:
- What the button properties are
- Which switch case matches
- Whether duplicate or delete is called
- How many components exist before/after

This will tell us exactly why delete is creating duplicates.
