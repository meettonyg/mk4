# State Manager Implementation

This document outlines the changes made to align the saving mechanism with the state management system.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated Save Service**
   - Modified `save-service.js` to use `stateManager.getSerializableState()` instead of the custom `collectComponentData()` function
   - Removed the custom `collectComponentData()` function as it's no longer needed
   - Updated the auto-save functionality to use the state manager as well
   - Currently still saving to localStorage as requested

2. **Added Local Storage Loading**
   - Added a `loadFromLocalStorage()` function to main.js
   - Modified the initialization process to load from localStorage if no media kit ID is provided
   - This allows for testing the save/load functionality without server communication

3. **Set Up Save System with Enhanced Features**
   - Added explicit `setupSaveSystem()` call in the enhanced features initialization path

## Next Steps for Server Implementation

When ready to implement server-side saving, the following changes will be needed:

1. Update the `saveMediaKit()` function in `save-service.js` to:
   - Use AJAX to send the state to the server
   - Call the WordPress AJAX endpoint `gmkb_save_media_kit`
   - Handle success/failure responses
   - Update the UI accordingly

The PHP backend already has the necessary AJAX handler in `enhanced-ajax.php`:
- `gmkb_ajax_save_media_kit()` function saves the state to the post meta
- `gmkb_ajax_load_media_kit()` function loads the state from the post meta

## Testing

To test the current implementation:
1. Make changes to the media kit
2. Save using the save button
3. Reload the page
4. The media kit should load from localStorage with your changes

This confirms that the state serialization and deserialization is working correctly.
