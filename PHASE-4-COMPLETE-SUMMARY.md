## 🎓 Key Learnings

### What Went Well ✅
1. **Found Existing Work**: Components were already converted
2. **Fast Implementation**: Testing infrastructure set up quickly
3. **Good Documentation**: Comprehensive guides created
4. **Clear Patterns**: Consistent architecture throughout
5. **Strong Foundation**: Ready for Phase 5

### What Could Be Better 🔧
1. **Test-First**: Should have tested during component creation
2. **Earlier Setup**: Testing infrastructure should have come first
