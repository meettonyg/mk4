# Theme ID Fix - Final Solution

## Problem
All themes were showing as "ACTIVE" in the Theme Customizer because their `id` properties were becoming `undefined` when accessed through Vue components.

## Root Cause (Identified by Gemini)
The issue was caused by using `Object.defineProperty()` to set the `id` property in the theme store. While intended to "protect" the ID, this actually interfered with Vue's Proxy-based reactivity system, causing the `id` to be undefined when accessed from Vue components.

## The Fix
Replace the problematic `Object.defineProperty()` approach with standard object literal syntax that Vue's reactivity system can properly track.

### Code Changed
In `src/stores/theme.js`, the `initialize` action was modified to use standard object literal syntax:

**Before (Broken):**
```javascript
const newTheme = {};
Object.defineProperty(newTheme, 'id', {
  value: theme.id || `theme_${index}`,
  writable: true,
  enumerable: true,
  configurable: true
});
// Set other properties...
```

**After (Fixed):**
```javascript
const newTheme = {
  id: theme.id || `theme_${index}`,
  name: theme.name || 'Unnamed Theme',
  description: theme.description || '',
  // ... all properties in one object literal
};
```

## Why This Fix Works
- **Reactivity Safe**: Standard object literals work correctly with Vue's Proxy-based reactivity system
- **Simpler Code**: Eliminates confusing `Object.defineProperty()` calls
- **Centralized Solution**: Fixes the data corruption at its source (the store), so all components work correctly

## Files Modified
1. `src/stores/theme.js` - Fixed theme object creation to use standard object literals
2. Removed unnecessary workarounds (rawThemes, getAvailableThemes getter)
3. Reverted ThemeSwitcher workaround since it's no longer needed

## Build & Test
```bash
# Build the project
BUILD.bat

# Clear browser cache and reload
# Test: Only the active theme should show "ACTIVE" badge
```

## Verification
After building and reloading:
- Console logs should show theme IDs are preserved
- Theme Customizer should only show one "ACTIVE" badge
- Clicking themes should switch properly

## Credits
Thanks to Gemini for correctly identifying that `Object.defineProperty()` was interfering with Vue's reactivity system. This was the exact root cause that needed to be fixed.
