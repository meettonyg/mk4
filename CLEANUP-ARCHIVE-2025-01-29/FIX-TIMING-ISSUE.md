# üîß FIXED: Timing Issue with Button Checks

## Problem
Warnings appearing in console:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Theme Button (#global-theme-btn) not found
‚ö†Ô∏è Save Button (#save-btn) not found
‚ùå Some UI elements are missing
```

## Root Cause
In `src/main.js`, the initialization code was checking for button elements **BEFORE Vue had mounted and created them**:

```javascript
// WRONG - checks before Vue mounts
if (isPureVueMode && mountPoint) {
  mountPoint.innerHTML = '';
  
  // This runs BEFORE Vue creates the buttons!
  const requiredElements = {
    '#global-theme-btn': 'Theme Button',
    '#save-btn': 'Save Button'
  };
  
  // Checks fail because Vue hasn't rendered yet
  for (const [selector, name] of Object.entries(requiredElements)) {
    if (!document.querySelector(selector)) {
      logger.warn(`‚ö†Ô∏è ${name} not found`);
    }
  }
}
```

## Solution ‚úÖ
Removed the premature element checks:

```javascript
// CORRECT - don't check before Vue mounts
if (isPureVueMode && mountPoint) {
  mountPoint.innerHTML = '';
  
  // NOTE: UI elements like #global-theme-btn will be created by Vue after mount
  // Do not check for them here - they don't exist yet!
}
```

## Timeline
```
1. main.js runs
2. Checks for buttons ‚ùå (They don't exist yet!)
3. Vue mounts
4. Vue creates toolbar with buttons ‚úÖ
5. Buttons now exist and work
```

The buttons were working fine - we were just checking too early!

## Files Changed
- `src/main.js` - Removed premature element checks

## Testing
After rebuild:
1. No warnings in console ‚úÖ
2. Theme button works ‚úÖ
3. Save button works ‚úÖ
4. All buttons created by Vue after mount ‚úÖ

---

## Next Steps
```bash
npm run build
```

Then refresh and test - no more warnings! üéâ

**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED  
**Issue**: Timing - checking before Vue mount  
**Solution**: Removed premature checks  
**Result**: Clean console, all buttons work
