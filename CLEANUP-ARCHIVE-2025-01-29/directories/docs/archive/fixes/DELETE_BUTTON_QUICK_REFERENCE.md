# Delete Button Issue - Quick Reference

## The Problem
When you click the delete button (×) on a component, it creates a duplicate instead of deleting it.

## To Debug the Issue

Run these scripts in order:

```javascript
// 1. Enhanced debugging
const s1 = document.createElement('script');
s1.src = 'debug-delete-enhanced.js';
document.head.appendChild(s1);

// 2. Test switch statement
const s2 = document.createElement('script');
s2.src = 'test-switch-statement.js';
document.head.appendChild(s2);
```

Then click a delete button and share the console output.

## Manual Delete (Alternative)
To manually delete a component:
1. Right-click the component and inspect element
2. Find the `data-component-id` attribute (e.g., "hero-1234567890-abc")
3. Run in console:
```javascript
window.stateManager.removeComponent('hero-1234567890-abc');
```

## What I've Done So Far

### 1. Fixed Architecture Issues
- Component Manager no longer manipulates DOM (only state)
- Component Renderer handles all DOM updates
- This fixed the duplicate rendering issue

### 2. Added Debugging
- Enhanced logging throughout the delete process
- Created debug tools to trace the issue
- Added Unicode symbol support for button detection

### 3. Prevented Common Issues
- Added checks to prevent duplicate event listeners
- Made sure edits are saved before any action
- Added proper async handling

## To Help Debug

Run the debug script:
```javascript
const script = document.createElement('script');
script.src = 'debug-delete-button.js';
document.head.appendChild(script);
```

Then click a delete button and send me the console output.

## Possible Causes
1. Character encoding mismatch with × symbol
2. Event bubbling causing multiple handlers
3. State synchronization timing issue
4. Component type-specific problem

The other fixes (duplicate rendering and edit loss) are working correctly now.
