# Delete Button Issue Investigation

## Problem Description
When clicking the delete button (×) on a component, instead of deleting the component, it creates a duplicate of it.

## Changes Made to Debug

### 1. Added Debug Logging
- Added console logs in `component-renderer.js` to track control button clicks
- Added console logs in `state-manager.js` to track component removal
- Created `debug-delete-button.js` test script

### 2. Prevented Duplicate Event Listeners
- Added `data-interactive` attribute check in `setupComponentInteractivity()`
- This prevents multiple event listeners from being attached to the same component

### 3. Improved Action Detection
- Enhanced the switch statement to check for Unicode symbols (×, ⧉, ↑, ↓)
- Added fallback to use button text content if title doesn't match
- Added default case to catch unknown actions

### 4. Removed Direct DOM Manipulation
- `component-manager.js` no longer manipulates DOM directly
- Only updates state, letting Component Renderer handle all DOM updates

## Possible Causes

### 1. Character Encoding Issue
The × symbol might not be matching correctly due to encoding differences.

### 2. Multiple Event Listeners
If event listeners are being added multiple times, clicking delete might trigger multiple actions.

### 3. State Synchronization
There might be a timing issue between state updates and DOM rendering.

### 4. Component Re-rendering
When a component is deleted, the re-render might be creating it again due to stale state.

## How to Test

1. Load the builder page
2. Open browser console
3. Run: `const script = document.createElement('script'); script.src = 'debug-delete-button.js'; document.head.appendChild(script);`
4. Try clicking the delete button on any component
5. Check console output for debug messages

## Expected Console Output
```
Control button clicked - Action: Delete, Component: hero-xxxxx
Button text: '×'
Delete case triggered
User confirmed deletion
Calling stateManager.removeComponent
StateManager.removeComponent called for: hero-xxxxx
Component hero-xxxxx deleted from state
isDeletingComponent flag cleared
```

## What to Look For
1. Is "Delete case triggered" shown or "Duplicate case triggered"?
2. Are there multiple "Control button clicked" messages for a single click?
3. Does the component ID in the state match what's being deleted?
4. Are there any "Unknown control action" warnings?

## Temporary Workaround
If the issue persists, you can manually delete a component by running in console:
```javascript
// Replace 'component-id' with the actual ID
window.stateManager.removeComponent('component-id');
```
