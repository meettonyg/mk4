# What to Do Right Now

You got a 404 error because the browser is looking for scripts in the wrong location. Here's the simplest solution:

## 1. Open This File
```
C:\Users\seoge\OneDrive\Desktop\CODE-Guestify\MEDIAKIT\PLUGIN\mk4\debug-inline-test.js
```

## 2. Copy Everything
- Select all (Ctrl+A)
- Copy (Ctrl+C)

## 3. Paste into Console
- Go to your builder page (where you see the components)
- Open browser console (F12)
- Click in the console area
- Paste (Ctrl+V)
- Press Enter

## 4. Click a Delete Button
- Find any component with the × button
- Click the × button
- Watch the console

## 5. Send Me the Output
- Copy everything that appears in the console
- Include all the test results and error messages

## What This Will Show

The debug script will:
- Test the switch statement with different values
- Analyze the actual delete buttons on your page
- Monitor what happens when you click delete
- Show if duplicate is being called instead of delete
- Count components before and after

This will definitively show why delete is creating duplicates instead of deleting.

No need to worry about paths or loading external scripts - everything runs inline!
