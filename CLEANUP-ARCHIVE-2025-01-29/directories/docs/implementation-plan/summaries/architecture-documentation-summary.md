# Architecture Documentation Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

1. **Architecture Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive ARCHITECTURE.md file
   - Documented key architectural concepts
   - Included code examples for main patterns
   - Added detailed explanations of core systems

2. **Visual Diagrams**
   - Created diagrams directory
   - Created system architecture diagram (system-architecture.mmd)
   - Created data flow diagram (data-flow.mmd)
   - Created component lifecycle diagram (component-lifecycle.mmd)
   - Created template caching process diagram (template-caching.mmd)

3. **Documentation Sections**
   - Introduction and key architectural principles
   - Core architecture and component relationships
   - State management patterns and examples
   - Component system and schema-driven architecture
   - Performance optimizations
   - Extension points
   - Development workflow

## Success Criteria Fulfillment

- ✅ **Clear data flow diagram included**: Created detailed data-flow.mmd with sequence diagram
- ✅ **All major components documented**: Comprehensive coverage of state manager, component manager, renderer, etc.
- ✅ **Extension points identified**: Documented custom component development, data binding integration, and schema customization
- ✅ **Code examples for each pattern**: Included practical examples for state updates, component management, and more

## Next Steps

1. Review documentation with team
2. Consider adding more specific examples for common development tasks
3. Update as system evolves
4. Link to component development guide when completed

The architecture documentation provides a solid foundation for understanding the Media Kit Builder system and will help new developers get up to speed quickly.
