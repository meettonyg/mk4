# Media Kit Builder - Implementation Quick Reference

## 🚀 Start Here

You are currently in **Phase 6** of an 8-phase refactoring plan. Phases 1-5 are complete with the enhanced system running under feature flags.

### Current Status
- ✅ Enhanced State Manager (working)
- ✅ Enhanced Component Manager (working)
- ✅ Enhanced Component Renderer (working)
- ✅ Proper initialization (working)
- ✅ Feature flags enabled (monitoring)
- 🔄 Performance optimization (Phase 6)
- ⏳ Testing & validation (Phase 7)
- ⏳ Cleanup & documentation (Phase 8)

## 📋 Priority Order

### Week 1: Performance & Polish
1. **Template Caching** (Prompt 6.1) - Biggest performance win
2. **Loading Indicators** (Prompt 6.2) - Professional UX
3. **Toast Notifications** (Prompt 6.3) - Modern feedback
4. **Schema Validation** (Prompt 7.1) - Identify issues

### Week 2: Testing & Cleanup
5. **Component Refactoring** (Prompt 7.2) - Reduce code
6. **Test Suite** (Prompt 7.3) - Automated testing
7. **Documentation** (Prompt 8.1) - Architecture guide
8. **Performance Monitor** (Prompt 8.2) - Track metrics
9. **Legacy Removal** (Prompt 8.3) - Final cleanup

## 🎯 Key Metrics to Track

| Operation | Target | Current |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Component Add (cached) | <100ms | ? |
| State Save | <50ms | ✓ |
| Full Re-render | <200ms | ✓ |
| Control Actions | <300ms | ✓ |
| Cache Hit Rate | >90% | ? |

## ⚡ Quick Commands

```javascript
// Check feature flags
window.mediaKitFeatures.FEATURES

// Performance report  
window.mkPerf.report()

// Test components
window.mkTest.addRapidComponents()

// Validate state
window.mkDiag.checkState()
```

## 🛡️ Safety Checklist

Before removing legacy code:
- [ ] 2 weeks stable operation
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Performance targets met
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Backup branch created

## 📁 Key Files

### Phase 6 (Performance)
- `js/components/dynamic-component-loader.js` - Template caching
- `css/admin-styles.css` - Loading indicators
- `components/*/panel-script.js` - Toast notifications

### Phase 7 (Testing)
- `js/core/enhanced-component-manager.js` - Schema validation
- `components/*/component.json` - Schema updates
- `tests/*` - Test suite

### Phase 8 (Cleanup)
- `js/components/component-manager.js` - To be removed
- `js/core/conditional-loader.js` - To be removed
- `docs/*` - Documentation

## 💡 Implementation Tips

1. **Template Caching**: Use plugin version for cache invalidation
2. **Loading States**: One consistent spinner design
3. **Schema First**: Update JSON before removing JS code
4. **Test Often**: Run mkTest commands after each change
5. **Document Changes**: Update CHANGELOG.md as you go

## 🚨 Common Issues

### Components not rendering after cache implementation
- Check: Template hydration logic
- Fix: Ensure props are properly replaced

### Loading spinner stuck
- Check: Finally block in fetch
- Fix: Always remove class even on error

### Schema validation too noisy
- Check: Console filter
- Fix: Group warnings by component type

### Tests failing after refactor
- Check: Mock setup in tests/setup.js
- Fix: Update mocks to match new structure

## 📊 Progress Tracking

Create a simple progress tracker:

```markdown
## Implementation Progress

### Phase 6: Performance ⏳
- [ ] Template caching
- [ ] Loading indicators  
- [ ] Toast notifications

### Phase 7: Testing ⏳
- [ ] Schema validation
- [ ] Component refactoring (0/3)
- [ ] Test suite setup
- [ ] All tests passing

### Phase 8: Cleanup ⏳
- [ ] Architecture docs
- [ ] Performance monitor

- [ ] Final validation
```

## 🎉 Success Criteria

The implementation is complete when:
1. All components load instantly (after first use)
2. Every async operation has visual feedback
3. No alert() dialogs remain
4. Test coverage > 80%
5. All legacy code removed
6. Documentation complete
7. Performance dashboard green
