# Backup Checklist - Before Phase 2

**Purpose:** Ensure safe rollback capability before making any changes  
**Required Before:** Proceeding to Phase 2 (Clean API Layer)  
**Estimated Time:** 30-60 minutes

---

## üéØ Why Backups Are Critical

Phase 2 involves:
- Creating new REST API endpoints
- Modifying database query patterns
- Potentially changing data structures
- Removing legacy AJAX handlers

**If something goes wrong**, you need to be able to:
- Restore the database to its current state
- Restore files to their current state
- Get back to a working system quickly

## üéØ Quick Backup Script (Optional)

For future convenience, here's a PowerShell script to automate backups:

```powershell
# File: scripts/create-backup.ps1

$timestamp = Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd-HHmm"
$backupDir = "BACKUPS/backup-$timestamp"

Write-Host "Creating backup: $backupDir"

# Create backup directory
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $backupDir -Force

# Backup plugin files
Write-Host "Backing up plugin files..."
Compress-Archive -Path "." -DestinationPath "$backupDir/plugin-files.zip" -Force

# Backup package files
Copy-Item "package.json" -Destination "$backupDir/"
Copy-Item "package-lock.json" -Destination "$backupDir/"

# Create backup manifest
@"
Backup Created: $timestamp
Plugin Version: $(Get-Content package.json | ConvertFrom-Json).version
Node Version: $(node --version)
Files Included: plugin-files.zip
Status: Complete
"@ | Out-File "$backupDir/manifest.txt"

Write-Host "‚úÖ Backup complete: $backupDir"
Write-Host "Remember to also backup your database!"
```

**Usage:** `powershell scripts/create-backup.ps1`
