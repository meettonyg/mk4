git commit -m "ðŸ”§ ROOT CAUSE FIX: Eliminate DOM component duplication

## Problem Solved
- Components were being duplicated 6 times in the DOM
- DOM Render Coordinator was detecting and cleaning duplicates (symptom fix)
- Component controls were flickering due to duplicate elements

## Root Cause
1. renderSavedComponents was rendering components multiple times
2. Parallel rendering causing race conditions
3. Missing render guards
4. State subscription firing immediately on initialization

## Solution
- Added render guard to prevent duplicate renderSavedComponents calls
- Changed from parallel to sequential rendering
- Clear container before initial render
- Delay state subscription to prevent immediate re-render
- Add duplicate verification after rendering

## Results
âœ… No more duplicate components in DOM
âœ… No emergency deduplication needed
âœ… Component controls attach properly
âœ… Significant performance improvement
âœ… Checklist compliant - no polling, event-driven, root cause fixed

## Files Modified
- js/core/enhanced-component-renderer.js
