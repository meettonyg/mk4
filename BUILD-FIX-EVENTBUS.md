# Build Fix Applied ✅

## Issue
Build was failing because `EventBus` was being imported as a named export when it's actually a default export.

## Error
```
"EventBus" is not exported by "src/services/EventBus.js"
```

## Fix Applied
Changed all imports from:
```javascript
import { EventBus } from './EventBus.js';
```

To:
```javascript
import eventBus from './EventBus.js';
```

## Files Fixed
1. ✅ `src/services/UndoRedoManager.js` - 6 instances
2. ✅ `src/services/KeyboardManager.js` - 20 instances

## Verification
Run build again:
```bash
npm run build
```

Should now complete successfully.

## Root Cause
The EventBus.js file exports as:
```javascript
export default eventBus;
```

But we were trying to import as a named export `{ EventBus }`.

## Status
✅ Fixed and ready to rebuild
