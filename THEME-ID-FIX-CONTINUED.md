## Theme ID Issue - Continued Fix

After rebuilding, the issue persists. The themes are showing their IDs are preserved during processing but becoming undefined when accessed through Vue components.

### Console Evidence Shows Two-Stage Issue:

1. **Initial Processing - WORKING** ✅
```javascript
[Theme Store] Processing theme: Professional Clean {originalId: 'professional_clean', processedId: 'professional_clean', idMatch: true}
```

2. **Component Access - BROKEN** ❌
```javascript
[ThemeSwitcher] First theme ID: undefined
[ThemesPanel] Theme 0: {id: undefined, name: 'Professional Clean', ...}
```

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue appears to be a Vue/Pinia reactivity problem where the `id` property is not being properly tracked or is being stripped when the object goes through Vue's reactive proxy system.

### Solution Applied
Used JSON.parse(JSON.stringify()) to create clean, non-reactive objects before storing them in Pinia state. This prevents Vue's reactivity system from interfering with the object properties.

### Additional Fix Needed
The computed properties in components might also need adjustment to properly access the reactive state.
