# Component Library Cleanup - Complete Removal of Legacy Code

## What Was Removed

### 1. PHP Files
- **DELETED**: `partials/component-library-modal.php` (moved to .backup)
  - This was the old PHP modal template with hardcoded HTML
  - Removed from builder-template.php includes

### 2. Legacy Modal Code
- **NO LONGER INCLUDED**: The PHP modal is not loaded anywhere
- **BLOCKED**: Any dynamically created modals with id="component-library-modal"
- **CLEANUP SCRIPT**: `js/legacy-modal-cleanup.js` actively prevents legacy modal creation

### 3. Simplified Architecture
- **REMOVED**: All workarounds and patches for dual-modal conflict
- **CLEANED**: component-library-bridge.js is now minimal and clean

## What Remains (Clean Architecture)

### Vue Component Only
- `src/vue/components/ComponentLibrary.vue` - The ONLY component library implementation
- Full featured with:
  - Sidebar categories (dynamically discovered from component.json files)
  - Search functionality
  - Dropdown filtering
  - Reactive filtering based on user interaction

### Clean Event-Driven Connection
- `js/component-library-bridge.js` - Simple event bridge
- No polling, no patches, just clean event handling

### Blocking Script
- `js/legacy-modal-cleanup.js` - Ensures no legacy modal can be created
- Will be removed once we confirm no legacy code exists in bundles

## Architecture Compliance

✅ **Single Source of Truth**: Only Vue ComponentLibrary exists
✅ **No Redundancy**: Legacy modal completely removed
✅ **Event-Driven**: Clean event bridge connects button to Vue
✅ **Self-Contained**: Components discovered from filesystem
✅ **No Patches**: Removed all conflict resolution code

## Testing

1. Build Vue app: `npm run build`
2. Clear browser cache
3. Open Media Kit Builder
4. Click "Add Component" button
5. Should see ONLY the Vue component library with sidebar and filters

## Future Cleanup

Once confirmed working, can remove:
- `js/legacy-modal-cleanup.js` (blocking script)
- `partials/component-library-modal.php.backup` (backup file)
