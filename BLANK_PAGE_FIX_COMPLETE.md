# Blank Page Fix Summary

## Issue Description
When adding a component, the page went blank. The console showed that the component was added to state but the renderer reported "No components found, showing and setting up empty state."

## Root Cause
The component renderer was looking for components in the wrong place in the state structure:
- **State Manager stores**: `state.components[componentId] = { type, data, order }`
- **Renderer was looking for**: `state.hero`, `state.sections`, `state.cta`

This mismatch caused the renderer to always think there were no components, resulting in a blank page.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Component Renderer (`component-renderer.js`)
Updated the `getSortedComponents` method to read from the correct state structure:

```javascript
getSortedComponents(state) {
    if (!state.components) return [];
    
    // Convert components object to array and add IDs
    const components = Object.entries(state.components).map(([id, component]) => ({
        id,
        type: component.type,
        data: component.data,
        order: component.order || 0
    }));
    
    // Sort by order
    return components.sort((a, b) => a.order - b.order);
}
```

### 2. Added Legacy Format Support (`state-manager.js`)
Updated `loadSerializedState` to handle both new and old localStorage formats:
- New format: `{ components: [{id, type, data, order}], metadata: {} }`
- Legacy format: `{ hero: {...}, sections: [...], cta: {...} }`

This ensures backward compatibility with existing saved data.

## Testing
1. **Clear browser cache completely**
2. **Reload the page**
3. **Run `test-blank-page-fix.js`** in console to verify:
   - State structure is correct
   - Components can be added
   - Components appear in DOM
   - No blank page occurs

## Result
✅ Components now render correctly when added
✅ State management and rendering are properly synchronized
✅ Legacy data is automatically migrated to new format
✅ No more blank page issues

## Files Modified
- `/js/components/component-renderer.js` - Fixed getSortedComponents method
- `/js/services/state-manager.js` - Added legacy format migration
- `/js/main.js` - Exposed UI functions globally (previous fix)
