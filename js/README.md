# JavaScript Directory 
 
This directory contains ONLY shared utilities that work with both architectures. 
 
- `/utils` - Shared utility functions 
- `/api` - API integration (WordPress AJAX, REST) 
- `/shared` - Shared constants and helpers 
 
**DO NOT** put architecture-specific code here! 
- Vue code goes in `/src` 
- Legacy code goes in `/js-legacy`
