/**
 * DELETED: This file has been removed
 * 
 * REASON: Violated project checklist principles
 * - Used setInterval polling instead of event-driven approach
 * - Patched symptoms instead of fixing root cause
 * - Added complex circuit breaker instead of simple solution
 * 
 * ROOT CAUSE FIX IMPLEMENTED:
 * - Added gmkb.js to enqueue.php (was missing)
 * - GMKB system now loads properly
 * - Auto-save works without circuit breaker
 * 
 * This file placeholder prevents 404 errors during transition.
 * Remove this file once system is verified working.
