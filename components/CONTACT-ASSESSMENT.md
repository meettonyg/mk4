## Notes

**This component appears to have already been refactored!**

Based on earlier documentation, it previously had:
- LinkedIn
- Twitter
- Instagram
- Facebook

These have been **removed** (good!), leaving only legitimate contact fields:
- Email (direct communication)
- Phone (direct communication)
- Website (primary online presence)
- Address (physical location)

**Website field here is appropriate** because:
- It's a primary contact point
- Different from social media platforms
- Standard contact information

---

## Recommendation

**NO CHANGES NEEDED** ✅

Contact component is properly scoped to communication channels.
