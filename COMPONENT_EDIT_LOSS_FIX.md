# Component Edit Loss Fix

## Problem
When editing content in a component and then clicking the arrow controls to move it up/down, the edits were lost and the component reverted to its previous state.

## Root Cause
The move operation triggered an immediate re-render from state, but the contenteditable blur event (which saves changes) hadn't fired yet because the user clicked directly on the control button without blurring the editable field first.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added `saveActiveEditableContent()` Method
In `component-manager.js`, added a method that:
- Finds any currently focused contenteditable element
- Triggers blur() to save its content
- Checks all contenteditable elements for unsaved changes
- Returns a Promise to ensure async completion

```javascript
saveActiveEditableContent() {
    const activeElement = document.activeElement;
    
    if (activeElement && activeElement.contentEditable === 'true') {
        activeElement.blur();
        return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 50));
    }
    
    // Also check for any contenteditable with unsaved changes
    const editables = document.querySelectorAll('[contenteditable="true"]');
    editables.forEach(editable => {
        const originalContent = editable.getAttribute('data-original-content');
        if (originalContent !== null && originalContent !== editable.textContent) {
            editable.blur();
        }
    });
    
    return Promise.resolve();
}
```

### 2. Made Control Actions Async
- `handleControlAction()` - Now async and awaits save
- `moveComponent()` - Now async and awaits save before reordering
- Control button click handlers in component-renderer.js - Now async

### 3. Enhanced Change Tracking
In `component-renderer.js`, added focus event listener to contenteditable elements:
- Stores original content on focus in `data-original-content` attribute
- Clears the attribute on blur after saving
- Enables proper detection of unsaved changes

## Result
- Content edits are automatically saved before any component manipulation
- No more lost edits when moving, duplicating, or deleting components
- Seamless user experience - changes are preserved transparently

## Testing
1. Edit text in a component
2. Without clicking elsewhere, immediately click move up/down arrow
3. Component should move with edits intact
4. Also test with duplicate and delete actions

## Files Modified
1. `js/components/component-manager.js` - Added save method, made actions async
2. `js/components/component-renderer.js` - Made handlers async, added focus tracking
