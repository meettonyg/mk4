# Script Loading Race Condition Fix

## Problem Description

We identified a critical race condition in the script loading process that was causing component data to be lost after page reloads. This occurred due to:

1. Multiple script loading mechanisms being used simultaneously:
   - WordPress PHP code was enqueuing individual JS modules with `wp_enqueue_script` in `includes/enhanced-ajax.php`
   - The main JavaScript file (`js/main.js`) was also loading these same modules using ES6 `import` statements

2. ES6 module scope isolation:
   - Variables imported in ES6 modules are scoped to that module and not automatically available globally
   - This meant other scripts couldn't access these objects unless explicitly exposed

3. Component manager initialization timing:
   - The component manager wasn't guaranteed to be fully initialized before other code tried to use it
   - This caused issues when trying to load and render saved components from localStorage

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Removed Duplicate Script Loading

Modified `includes/enhanced-ajax.php` to:
- Remove individual script enqueues for modules already imported by `main.js`
- Only localize data to the main script (`guestify-builder-script`)
- Removed potentially problematic CSS dependencies

### 2. Exposed Module Objects Globally

Added code to `js/main.js` to explicitly expose the module objects globally:
```javascript
// Make managers globally accessible for legacy scripts and debugging
window.stateManager = stateManager;
window.componentManager = componentManager;
window.dataBindingEngine = dataBindingEngine;
window.historyService = historyService;
```

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Single Entry Point**: The application now has a single entry point (`main.js`) that handles all module loading via ES6 imports
2. **Reliable Object Access**: All essential objects are explicitly exposed to the global scope, ensuring any code can access them
3. **Eliminated Race Conditions**: By removing duplicate loading mechanisms, we've eliminated the timing issues

## Testing Recommendation

After deploying these changes:
1. Add components to your media kit
2. Save your changes
3. Refresh the page
4. Verify that all components load correctly without errors
