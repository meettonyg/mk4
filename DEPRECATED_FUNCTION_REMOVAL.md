# Deprecated Function Removal

## Elimination of `saveCurrentState` Calls

We've removed references to the deprecated `saveCurrentState()` function in the element editor. This function was part of the legacy history tracking system, but is no longer necessary with the enhanced state management system.

### Changes Made:

1. **Removed import**:
   ```javascript
   // Removed this import
   import { saveCurrentState } from '../services/history-service.js';
   ```

2. **Removed function calls**:
   - Removed calls in the blur event handler for contenteditable elements
   - Removed calls in the `deleteSelectedElement()` function

### Why This Matters:

The new state management system (`stateManager`) automatically tracks state changes for history purposes. There's no need to explicitly call a function to save the current state, as this happens automatically whenever state is modified through the proper channels.

This change:
- Eliminates console warnings about using deprecated functions
- Ensures consistent history tracking
- Properly integrates with the new state management architecture

The state manager now handles:
- Recording state history automatically
- Tracking changes for undo/redo
- Managing history size and indexing

This change is part of the ongoing effort to fully migrate to the enhanced schema-driven system and eliminate legacy code paths.
