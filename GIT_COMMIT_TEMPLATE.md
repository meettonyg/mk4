fix: resolve store initialization race conditions

ROOT CAUSE FIX: Changed initialization order to prevent race conditions
between main.js and MediaKitApp.vue competing to initialize stores.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Initialization Order (src/main.js)
- BEFORE: Vue mounted before stores initialized → race condition
- AFTER: Stores initialize BEFORE Vue mounts → clean sequence
- New order: Pinia → Stores → Data → Theme → Vue Mount

### 2. Removed Emergency Init Logic (src/vue/components/MediaKitApp.vue)
- Removed duplicate initialization code
- Simplified to simple verification check
- Stores guaranteed to be ready when component mounts

### 3. Added Missing Method (src/stores/theme.js)
- Added getTheme(themeId) getter for backwards compatibility
- Prevents "getTheme is not a function" errors

## Issues Fixed

- ✅ Eliminated "Store not initialized" warnings
- ✅ Eliminated "Store is already initializing" warnings  
- ✅ Fixed "TypeError: t.getTheme is not a function"
- ✅ Removed emergency initialization code
- ✅ Clean, predictable startup sequence

## Testing

Verified in browser:
- No console errors on page load
- Correct initialization sequence (steps 4-6 before step 8)
- Theme loads properly
- Components render correctly

## Architecture

Follows principle: "FIX THE CODE DIRECTLY AT THE ROOT LEVEL"
- No patches, no workarounds, no timeouts
- Root cause fixed with proper initialization order

Files modified:
- src/main.js (initialization order)
- src/vue/components/MediaKitApp.vue (removed emergency init)
- src/stores/theme.js (added getTheme method)
```
