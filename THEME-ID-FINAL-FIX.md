# Final Theme ID Fix Summary

## The Problem
All themes are showing as "ACTIVE" in the Theme Customizer because their `id` fields become `undefined` when accessed through Vue components, despite being correctly set during initialization.

## Root Cause
Vue 3's reactivity system appears to be stripping or interfering with the `id` property when the theme objects are made reactive through Pinia's store.

## Solution Applied (Multi-Part Fix)

### 1. Protected ID Property
Used `Object.defineProperty()` to define the `id` property with explicit descriptors, making it less susceptible to Vue's reactivity transformations.

### 2. Dual Storage Strategy
- Store raw themes outside reactive state for reliable access
- Also store in reactive state for components that need reactivity
- Added getter `getAvailableThemes` to access raw themes directly

### 3. Clean Data Cloning
Used proper object cloning to ensure clean objects without prototype pollution or reference issues.

### 4. Component Fix
Updated ThemeSwitcher to use the getter that bypasses reactivity issues when the normal access fails.

## Files Modified
1. `src/stores/theme.js` - Added dual storage and protected properties
2. `src/vue/components/ThemeSwitcher.vue` - Use fallback getter
3. `templates/builder-template-vue-pure.php` - Improved JSON encoding

## Build Instructions
```bash
# Run the build script to compile changes
BUILD.bat

# Or manually:
npm run build
```

## Testing
After building:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Reload the media kit builder
3. Open Theme Customizer
4. Only the currently active theme should show "ACTIVE" badge

## Verification
Run in console:
```javascript
// Should show proper IDs
window.themeStore.availableThemes.forEach((t, i) => {
  console.log(`Theme ${i}: id="${t.id}", name="${t.name}"`);
});

// Check raw themes
window.themeStore.getAvailableThemes.forEach((t, i) => {
  console.log(`Raw Theme ${i}: id="${t.id}", name="${t.name}"`);
});
```
